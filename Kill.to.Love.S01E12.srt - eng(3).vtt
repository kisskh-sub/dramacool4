(Episode 12)

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.440
Shu He.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.840
He doesn't have much time left.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
I remember you once said...

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.039
that two of the herbs
in Death-Feigning Medicine...

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.120
conflict with each other.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.880
Without a guiding agent,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.680
they're highly toxic.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.480
This dampness in the air...

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.160
feels like the wind from the south.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.760
At times,
when I can't sleep at night,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.040
I drift into a daze.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.800
Staring at the bit of sky
above the courtyard,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.720
I think I'm home again.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.360
I get up to take a walk...

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.520
but forgot the chains
still bound to my ankles.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.960
The chains tighten...

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.080
and the dream shatters.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.440
This medicine is perilous.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.960
Once taken,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.200
there's no turning back.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.480
Have you made up your mind?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Yes.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.720
I've been too optimistic.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.960
Had I not foolishly dreamed of
reconciling with the crown prince,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.360
I would have left the moment
I found the medicine...

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.720
and by now be living
the life I longed for.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.200
Had I not clung so blindly
to a future with Duan Zi Ang,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.000
had I been honest instead,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.760
the crown prince wouldn't have died.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.920
I simply wanted too much.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880
Shen Song.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.640
I'll tell Duan Zi Ang of the plan
to feign death and escape.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.920
Given his suspicious nature,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.840
this medicine can only pass
through your hands.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.840
For now,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.400
live the life you want.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.640
Shu He has lost.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.320
Should Your Highness
feel disheartened,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.520
you may come to me at any time.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.400
I'll keep my promise.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.640
My heart is sincere.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.960
I won't betray you even in the dark.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.280
He doesn't have much time left.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.640
Why put yourself through this?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.720
You're here.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.280
I've felt groggy
these past few days.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.240
Sometimes, I thought it was you.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.760
But when I woke,
it was all just nothing.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.480
Yet in my dreams,

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.280
your hand never bore that scar.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.920
Huai Yi sent you here, didn't he?

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.920
He acted on his own.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.320
He must have said
a lot of unpleasant things.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.720
Don't blame him.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.960
Shen Song said
you've been worrying too much.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.760
It's not good for your recovery.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.920
I've always wanted too much...

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520
but gotten too little.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.720
If life is lost,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.920
what's the point of wanting more?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.600
So you still care
for my life and death.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.760
What?

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.760
Do you want to die before me?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.800
Don't cry.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.080
Your tears...

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.240
hurt me worse than any blade.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.200
Shu He.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.040
I'm sorry.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920
You're sorry?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.160
You've done me wrong
plenty of times.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.160
Which one...

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.680
are you talking about now?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.880
Though I commanded
that no killing take place,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.800
if the people of South Hui Kingdom
resisted stubbornly,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.120
bloodshed was unavoidable.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.920
The reason South Hui Kingdom
fell so swiftly...

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.280
was because it had already
lost the people's trust.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.760
I know it's useless
to say anything now.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.960
But if I don't send troops,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.120
the people will rebel
sooner or later...

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.920
and you'll be killed
by your own people.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.920
Shu He.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.840
I made you a prisoner,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.000
a bird locked in a cage.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.640
I'm no different
from those you hate the most.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.160
Don't hate me anymore.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.440
It's not worth it.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.160
Duan Zi Ang.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.600
I amount to nothing...

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.360
and I own nothing.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.880
Whatever rests in my hands...

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.440
is nothing
more than a fleeting gift,

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.480
a mercy granted
by heaven and the gods.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.480
I hate you,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.320
but I hate myself more.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.240
I hate myself for running away
from my responsibilities.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.640
I don't care about politics.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.400
I can't be a good prince.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.480
I hate myself even more
for being weak...

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.760
and indecisive.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.760
I can't be a good king.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.320
What I hate the most...

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.120
is that I love you.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.200
If only I could live it
all over again...

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.360
If only I could live it
all over again...

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.240
Shen Song...

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.040
holds a formula
for Death-Feigning Medicine.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.320
I'm the fallen king,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.960
burdened with a hatred...

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.680
that can't be forgiven.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.080
However, if I weren't Xiao Shu He...

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.320
Let's do it again.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.520
Duan Zi Ang.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.840
Let's start over.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240
It's fine.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.920
I'm always like this.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.640
Let's go back to the palace.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.360
After I escape,
there's plenty of time.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.600
Take your time to recuperate.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.799
There's no rush.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.840
No.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.000
I don't want
to go back to the palace.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.000
Once you escape, you can no longer
carry the name Xiao Shu He.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.680
I only hope to spend
a single day with you openly...

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.240
as ordinary lovers.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.000
No distractions from the world,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.800
just Xiao Shu He...

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.040
and Duan Zi Ang.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.080
Sixth Prince's Manor?

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.520
Shu He, you're...

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.279
Your Highness,
I'm sorry for being rude.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:01.000
(Sixth Prince's Manor)

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.600
Why are you here?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.000
Are you leaving?

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.999
Your Highness wishes
to persuade Duan Zi Ang...

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.040
to escape through feigned death.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.480
Now that everything has settled,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.160
it's time I search
for where I belong.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.240
What's this?

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.600
Sesame candy.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.000
I went to the market
and bought some.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.280
I wanted to give them to you.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.920
It's rare...

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.280
to see you actually out shopping.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.760
Huo Ying.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.320
Do you still...

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.520
not like sweets?

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.600
I'm sorry.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.120
There are no flowers or trees
planted in my residence.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.160
If you wish to add some,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.960
the peach blossoms
of the North Kingdom are unrivaled.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.640
Why don't you plant peach trees?

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.040
They weren't planted by me.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.120
Back when I had just risen to power,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.840
I was constantly at war,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.720
shedding blood and bearing wounds.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.360
Once, after a defeat,

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.880
enemy troops pursued me.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.480
I hid beneath a tree.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.520
Amid the deafening clash
of battle surrounding me,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.240
I lost focus for a heartbeat,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.000
wondering...

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.760
what Shu He was up to then...

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.600
and if he was enjoying
pear-blossom pudding.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.480
Later, I gathered
skilled craftsmen...

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.080
to build this courtyard
around the pear tree.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.560
However, the pear blossoms...

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.000
were never meant to be trapped
behind the walls of the palace.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.440
At first,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.080
I only wished to shelter it
from the wind and rain.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.600
Though I never trained
in martial arts,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.080
I grew accustomed to practicing
the zither each morning.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.880
When I saw the pear blossoms
blooming here so beautifully,

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.000
I thought of you.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.040
You aren't good at martial arts.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.480
Why don't you
play the Yearning Zither...

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.200
for me over there?

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.040
Huo Ying.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.399
You have fulfilled your duty.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.520
What do you want to do next?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.679
I haven't decided yet,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.560
but first, I'll go out
and see the world.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.720
With Shen Song?

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.280
I don't need his business anyway.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.560
Besides, I haven't
been home for a long time.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.199
I want to return
to care for my parents...

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.280
and do some serious work.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.520
I'm putting down my burden,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.200
but you've taken up a new one.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880
What about you?

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120
What do you
want to do in the future?

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.480
What do you want to do, Shu He?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.280
I wanted to be a zither player...

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.800
and a poet.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.560
Now,

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520
it's a time for wandering,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.920
drinking,

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.240
and sleeping.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.440
And here I am,
the only poor soul left.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.320
Thank you
for your hard work, Huai Yi.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.160
Everything will fall
on your shoulders in the future.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.000
Zi Ang.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.559
I always thought...

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.960
you were a stubborn man,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.440
at least ambitious.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.880
I never thought that you'd give up
the throne for someone.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.080
Looks like I misjudged you.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.440
When I met Shu He again,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.160
he was already the sixth prince.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.320
If I want to be
with him for a long time,

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.800
I really need to be ambitious.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.920
Let's not talk about this.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.920
It wasn't easy for us
to get together today.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.400
Let's talk only about good things.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.760
I wonder when we'll meet again.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.800
Here's to our friendship.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.480
May the pear blossoms
bloom again next year...

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.320
and may we reunite.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.880
Previously,
in the northern border army camp,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.240
I saw local herders marry...

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.680
and share three bowls
of mare's milk wine.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.440
Today,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.800
you and I shall share
three bowls of nuptial wine,

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.520
shall we?

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.520
We should use golden scissors
to cut our hair.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.760
Use this.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.760
Legend has it in Beijiang...

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.200
that hair cut
with a bloodied blade...

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.200
ties the soul...

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.200
to the next world.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.400
The first cup...

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.720
is to Heaven and Earth.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.320
My Heaven and Earth...

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.560
has always been...

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.880
only you.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.440
The second cup...

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.560
is to the mountains and rivers.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.560
Every blossom
in the Central Plain thrives...

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.720
because of your just governance.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.480
The third cup...

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.480
is to you and me.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.400
To this stolen moment...

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.320
of a perfect hour.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.280
(Double happiness)

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.680
After taking the throne,
I have been at odds with fate.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.560
In the dead of night,
when I wake from dreams,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.760
the palace chamber is empty.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.800
I frequently question myself.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.680
In this vast and turbulent world,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.240
is there even a single place...

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.640
where I can truly rest?

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.560
Shu He.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.280
I'm glad I have you.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.800
Now that I think about it,
I'm really scared.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.680
Zi Ang.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.160
Among all the possible choices...

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.440
I have in this world,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.400
you're the best.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.400
You're the regret
I can't let go of in my heart.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.520
Knowing it's wrong...

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.800
yet still falling deeply into it.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.400
This is what I hold most dear.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.600
Zi Ang.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.320
You must remember this.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.760
If given the chance again,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.560
I would choose the same path.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.160
Do you have the antidote with you?

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800
Yes.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.960
Your Majesty.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.880
It's time.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.720
Life and death,
prosperity and decline,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.480
all are in heaven's hands.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.240
Duan Zi Ang.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.520
I...

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.120
love you.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.080
Listen up, everyone.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.320
The one who stands
before you today...

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.240
is the former ruler
of South Hui Kingdom, Xiao Shu He.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.920
As a prisoner of war, he repeatedly
broke the laws of the land,

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.760
conspired to rebel,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.280
and attempted
to overthrow the state.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.320
His crimes are evident
and they're unforgivable.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.000
See you later.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.680
The poisoned wine given today...

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.360
isn't for vengeance...

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.279
but to demonstrate
the authority of the law...

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.560
and warn future generations.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.520
All citizens of our country...

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.640
should take this as a lesson,

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.040
observe the law,

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.320
and don't repeat past mistakes.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.040
Shen Song.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.320
I beg you.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.000
Please give me
the dignity I deserve.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.240
Shu He.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.600
If you fear that
after Duan Zi Ang's death,

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.120
you would have no place
in the North Kingdom,

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.920
I'll find a way for you
to live incognito...

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.600
and enjoy your remaining years.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.320
Shen Song.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.920
You've always understood me best.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.400
Do you truly not know my intentions?

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.400
Must it come
at the cost of your life?

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.640
I'll use what he treasures most...

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.480
to take revenge on him.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.440
I'll use his suffering...

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.840
to atone to my father, my brother,

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.520
my love,

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.280
and to the people...

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.960
of South Hui Kingdom.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520
You lost.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.400
Shu He!

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.080
Shu He!

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.760
Shu He.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.240
You deceived me.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.480
You've deceived me my whole life.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.080
Brother.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.600
It has been years...

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.280
and you've grown distant now.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.040
I only remember...

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.800
that I've been waiting
for you here for a long time.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.800
Why are you waiting for me here?

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.800
I want to apologize to you.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.960
But I don't know why.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.840
I just want you
to know how sorry I am.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.560
I've been waiting...

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.120
for this all my life.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.440
Shall we go?

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.360
Let's take a look ahead.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.680
What's wrong?

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.480
I want to wait for someone too.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.520
When I died,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.440
I was in his arms.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.400
All right.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.520
You've changed.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.160
The resolve you once made
must be fulfilled.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.560
After waiting for so long,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.200
you just leave like that.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.080
Yes.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.440
I realized that if I don't change,

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.840
I'll just push
what I want further away.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.240
By the way,

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.880
who are you waiting for?

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.640
Shu He.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:02.240
(The End)
