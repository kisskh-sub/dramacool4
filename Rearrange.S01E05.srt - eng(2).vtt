WEBVTT

00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:01.818
(Previously) I'll have Lin help
out with the band for a while.

00:00:01.842 --> 00:00:03.569
That way you can focus on your work.

00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:05.004
I used to be very shy.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.469
So I had to wear a hat all the time.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.966
I have one at home.

00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:10.266
With you, it might become
something important.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:11.639
Nut.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.511
Let's go eat at our usual
chicken stir-fry place.

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:15.924
You like him, why don't you flirt with him?

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.677
What if he doesn't like me back?

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:20.091
See, you admit it. You like him.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.353
Hey, Win.

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:23.303
You're really serious.

00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:24.631
Thank heaven,

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:26.211
or whatever,

00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:27.611
for letting me go back in time

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:29.388
to make everything better like this.

"Rearrange" (Episode 5)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.200
(Men Detention Room)

00:02:15.788 --> 00:02:16.968
Hey, young man.

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:19.214
You can go home now.
Someone has bailed you out.

00:02:23.073 --> 00:02:24.367
This way, ma'am.

00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:34.250
Ma'am, please sign the document here.

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:35.281
Okay.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.190
Thank you.

00:02:58.623 --> 00:02:59.623
Mom.

00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:02.285
I...

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.451
Let's go home.

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:39.501
It must be my karma.

00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:41.854
To have to raise someone like you.

00:04:03.655 --> 00:04:04.661
Mom.

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:10.263
I'm sorry.

00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:18.145
You don't have to say anything.

00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:20.445
Just be good, that's enough.

00:04:37.853 --> 00:04:39.394
Hey, I'd say this concert

00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:41.095
is the best concert of the year.

00:04:41.316 --> 00:04:41.916
True.

00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:44.028
But they haven't released
the song "Stop It Now".

00:04:44.053 --> 00:04:45.853
Otherwise, we would
have heard it live today.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.542
Oh, I want to hear it.

00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:49.081
But I've heard it already.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.822
Oh, you've already heard it?

00:04:51.468 --> 00:04:52.882
Lin recorded it for me.

00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:54.642
I want to hear it too.

00:04:54.798 --> 00:04:56.858
You'll have to wait.
They'll release it soon.

00:04:58.526 --> 00:04:59.608
Just wait.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.169
Do you...

00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:06.996
have any plans to travel out of town soon?

00:05:07.245 --> 00:05:08.910
If it's around this time, I think...

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:11.055
You shouldn't go yet.

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:21.705
Hey.

00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:23.721
Is something wrong, Win?

00:05:25.522 --> 00:05:26.529
What?

00:05:49.461 --> 00:05:50.546
Dad.

00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:54.008
Do you think...

00:05:55.214 --> 00:05:56.376
that the future is really a result

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.487
of what we do in the present?

00:05:59.478 --> 00:06:00.478
Or

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.848
Is the future already determined?

00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.541
That's a strange question.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.840
Did you get your fortune told?

00:06:07.798 --> 00:06:09.017
No.

00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:11.210
I just want to know.

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:19.180
For me, I think...

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.323
Life...

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:24.896
might be like a song

00:06:25.276 --> 00:06:27.767
that's already been written
from beginning to end.

00:06:30.701 --> 00:06:32.548
What if we don't like the original song?

00:06:35.198 --> 00:06:36.238
Well,

00:06:37.683 --> 00:06:39.808
if you don't like the song that's written,

00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:44.085
you have to rearrange it.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.726
"Rearrange"?

00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:15.562
Win.

00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:18.499
Win.

00:08:18.927 --> 00:08:19.842
Oh, Nut.

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:20.949
Hello, sir.

00:08:20.973 --> 00:08:21.969
Hello.

00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:23.251
What are you doing here?

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:24.841
Is Win here?

00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:26.485
He's not here.

00:08:27.334 --> 00:08:28.624
Do you know where Win went?

00:08:28.648 --> 00:08:30.364
He went out this morning.

00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:33.164
Then I'll be going now.

00:08:33.188 --> 00:08:34.424
Okay.

00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:35.649
Take care.

00:08:49.584 --> 00:08:50.587
Ek.

00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:52.182
Is this Chai?

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:54.310
Let me see.

00:08:55.572 --> 00:08:56.572
Yeah.

00:08:56.612 --> 00:08:58.242
Yes, it's really Chai.

00:09:00.444 --> 00:09:01.889
I never thought

00:09:01.913 --> 00:09:04.028
that Chai would be a gangster like this.

00:09:04.643 --> 00:09:05.939
From now on, Ek,

00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:08.112
don't get involved with him anymore.

00:09:08.136 --> 00:09:09.610
I'm worried.

00:09:10.256 --> 00:09:11.025
But Mom.

00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:11.885
Ek.

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:13.625
No more "buts," son.

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:15.455
Look at this.

00:09:15.706 --> 00:09:16.843
This matter

00:09:16.867 --> 00:09:19.752
concerns your safety.

00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:23.498
Even the newspaper reported it.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.630
I'm strictly forbidding it.

00:09:28.043 --> 00:09:29.266
From now on,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:30.398
I will not allow you

00:09:30.422 --> 00:09:32.051
to go with Chai anymore.

00:09:34.588 --> 00:09:35.601
Yes, Dad.

00:09:38.187 --> 00:09:39.644
It's so scary.

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:41.404
How could this happen?

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:42.584
He seemed so well-behaved

00:09:42.608 --> 00:09:44.202
when he came to our house.

00:10:13.683 --> 00:10:16.063
This time, I couldn't help you again.

00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:27.306
So did it get better or worse?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:32.698
This time, you and I

00:10:32.722 --> 00:10:35.028
won't be able to buy tapes together again.

00:10:43.301 --> 00:10:44.914
You're a rocker, right?

00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:51.193
A rocker doesn't lose to
something like this, bro.

00:10:52.847 --> 00:10:54.287
You have to recover.

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.644
You have to do it.

00:11:12.286 --> 00:11:13.893

At least this time you
got to hear this song.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.893
The song hasn't been released yet.

00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:02.207
You must be wondering

00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:03.822
how I knew this song beforehand.

00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:08.264
If you want to know,

00:12:09.582 --> 00:12:11.182
you have to recover quickly.

00:12:13.455 --> 00:12:14.981
And then I'll tell you myself.

00:12:33.774 --> 00:12:34.974
I'm going now, bro.

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:39.905
See you.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.829
Explain it to me.

00:13:04.853 --> 00:13:07.517
You know you can't lie to me.

00:13:13.848 --> 00:13:14.723
Well...

00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:17.281
I just heard it from a recording they made.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.573
Then tell me where.

00:13:19.822 --> 00:13:21.928
On Jeeab's show, "See San Tonight".

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.132
He definitely didn't sing this much of it.

00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:25.218
Tell me.

00:13:25.242 --> 00:13:26.596
What are you hiding from me?

00:13:34.267 --> 00:13:35.661
I've told you before, right?

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.589
That I time-traveled from the future.

00:13:45.278 --> 00:13:47.522
Then why did you come from the future?

00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:49.585
Or were you turned into a robot

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.740
and sent on a Time Machine

00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:52.084
to come back and do some mission?

00:13:53.184 --> 00:13:54.459
You should go with Nut.

00:13:54.483 --> 00:13:55.630
You movie lovers.

00:13:55.655 --> 00:13:58.162
You just don't get Sci-Fi movies.

00:13:58.186 --> 00:13:59.401
So cool.

00:14:02.302 --> 00:14:03.302
Seriously.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.556
I don't know either

00:14:05.983 --> 00:14:07.384
how I got back here.

00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:09.731
It's weird.

00:14:09.831 --> 00:14:11.156
But you must know

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.670
what's going to happen, right?

00:14:12.736 --> 00:14:15.076
Like, will my mom win the lottery tomorrow?

00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:19.060
Whether your mom wins the lottery?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.167
That's not in my memory at all.

00:14:22.473 --> 00:14:24.565
Then just tell me the numbers

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:25.589
so I can win.

00:14:27.305 --> 00:14:29.818
I wasn't prepared to time travel back.

00:14:30.018 --> 00:14:32.208
If I knew I was going to time travel back,

00:14:32.608 --> 00:14:34.199
I would have written down many draws.

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.980
Hey, but I can tell you one thing.

00:14:38.205 --> 00:14:39.773
You have to buy Bitcoin.

00:14:40.135 --> 00:14:42.423
What is Bitcoin?

00:14:43.023 --> 00:14:43.818
Come on,

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:45.684
when the time comes, just buy it like I do.

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.658
Oh, in the future,

00:14:48.682 --> 00:14:50.463
do you and Nut end up together?

00:14:57.094 --> 00:14:58.448
I can only tell you that

00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:00.632
in the future,

00:15:00.656 --> 00:15:01.760
people of the same sex

00:15:01.784 --> 00:15:03.897
can holding hands in malls normally.

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:06.181
And get married legally too.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.293
Shit, really?

00:15:08.612 --> 00:15:09.819
Are you kidding?

00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:11.663
Why would I lie?

00:15:12.294 --> 00:15:13.365
Hey, and also,

00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:15.711
soon, in the future,

00:15:16.078 --> 00:15:17.409
people will be watching Y series

00:15:17.433 --> 00:15:19.226
and Yuri series all over the country.

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:22.104
Y series, Yuri series.

00:15:22.403 --> 00:15:23.668
What are those?

00:15:25.346 --> 00:15:27.789
They're dramas

00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:29.620
where the mail character
are of the same gender

00:15:29.644 --> 00:15:31.091
and they like each other.

00:15:32.013 --> 00:15:32.940
Shit.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.499
You're definitely lying.

00:15:34.587 --> 00:15:36.436
The neighbors

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.295
or even motorcycle taxi drivers

00:15:38.341 --> 00:15:40.582
will watching gay dramas
all over the country?

00:15:40.748 --> 00:15:41.888
I don't believe it.

00:15:42.473 --> 00:15:43.793
You'll just have to wait and see.

00:15:45.703 --> 00:15:46.866
Really?

00:15:47.273 --> 00:15:48.769
Oh, and in the future,

00:15:48.793 --> 00:15:49.856
do I get any taller?

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.880
What do you think?

00:15:52.032 --> 00:15:53.119
Maybe a little.

00:16:12.077 --> 00:16:13.597
Why are you back so late today?

00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:18.872
I was helping Paew deliver rice.

00:16:22.823 --> 00:16:24.303
Are you working harder because of me?

00:16:26.303 --> 00:16:28.449
I warmed up the food for you.

00:16:28.608 --> 00:16:30.797
Why didn't you just
eat and get it over with?

00:16:32.428 --> 00:16:33.772
I was waiting to eat with you.

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.498
Here, Mom,

00:16:37.522 --> 00:16:38.721
let's eat.

00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:42.096
There's a fragrant omelet and hot curry.

00:16:43.977 --> 00:16:45.351
Looks delicious.

00:16:46.385 --> 00:16:47.729
What's the occasion?

00:16:47.753 --> 00:16:49.432
Such good service.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.628
Hey.

00:16:50.666 --> 00:16:52.402
You told me to be good.

00:16:53.195 --> 00:16:54.870
Mmm, just be good.

00:16:54.894 --> 00:16:56.338
Don't cause me trouble.

00:16:56.362 --> 00:16:57.456
Not act weird.

00:16:58.151 --> 00:16:59.231
Mom.

00:16:59.571 --> 00:17:01.353
This time, I really feel guilty.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:03.896
Please forgive me, Mom.

00:17:04.578 --> 00:17:06.669
Okay, just don't do it again.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.780
I promise.

00:17:09.297 --> 00:17:10.541
You forgive me, right?

00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:12.674
Right? Right?

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.734
Geez, you're so persistent.

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:15.972
Let's just eat.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.251
I'll feed you.

00:17:17.276 --> 00:17:18.856
Here, this omelet.

00:17:19.202 --> 00:17:20.636
It's almost not hot anymore.

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:23.882
Is this even edible?

00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:26.501
Why wouldn't it be? It's delicious.

00:17:29.318 --> 00:17:30.318
Is it delicious?

00:17:30.558 --> 00:17:31.952
It's as delicious like I cook.

00:17:32.128 --> 00:17:33.188
You are the one who cooked this.

00:17:33.212 --> 00:17:34.592
Here, eat up.

00:17:50.588 --> 00:17:51.747
Hello.

00:17:57.258 --> 00:17:58.767
I'm Phop's brother.

00:17:59.277 --> 00:18:00.764
For now,

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:02.492
I'll be taking care of
the Phop's shop instead.

00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:03.523
Anyway,

00:18:04.085 --> 00:18:05.225
make yourselves at home.

00:18:15.584 --> 00:18:16.898
We miss Phop.

00:18:24.022 --> 00:18:25.330
Guys.

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:26.848
I have good news.

00:18:27.657 --> 00:18:30.771
The event organizers called to say...

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:34.329
that we've passed the first round!

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.420
Hey!

00:18:35.567 --> 00:18:36.607
Really?

00:18:36.892 --> 00:18:37.861
Shit.

00:18:37.885 --> 00:18:40.837
I'm going to play on a big stage!

00:18:42.522 --> 00:18:43.876
Everyone.

00:18:45.675 --> 00:18:47.155
I'm quitting the band.

00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:57.007
It's because of me, isn't it?

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.548
It's because of me, right?

00:19:16.542 --> 00:19:17.642
I knew it.

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:21.116
That it was because of me.

00:19:25.851 --> 00:19:27.485
Damn it.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.153
Can I talk to your parents?

00:20:59.613 --> 00:21:00.860
Sir, ma'am.

00:21:01.472 --> 00:21:02.932
May I have a word with you?

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:04.914
What is it?

00:21:07.431 --> 00:21:08.844
I'm truly sorry that

00:21:10.408 --> 00:21:12.208
I've made you worry.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.148
But can you please give us one more chance?

00:21:21.827 --> 00:21:23.253
If not for our sake, then

00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:26.431
consider it for Ek's sake.

00:21:33.487 --> 00:21:34.558
I think

00:21:34.764 --> 00:21:36.613
you would understand best

00:21:37.521 --> 00:21:38.895
how hard Ek has tried.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.570
Practicing until his hands hurt,

00:21:43.038 --> 00:21:44.725
and overcoming his fear

00:21:45.306 --> 00:21:46.826
to be able to play in front of people.

00:21:47.959 --> 00:21:49.525
You would understand best

00:21:50.845 --> 00:21:52.043
how hard Ek has tried.

00:21:53.849 --> 00:21:55.435
Please give us one more chance.

00:22:05.244 --> 00:22:06.915
And how can we be sure

00:22:06.939 --> 00:22:08.453
that Ek will be safe?

00:22:20.553 --> 00:22:21.553
I'm...

00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:24.603
resigning as the leader
of the Red Hawk gang.

00:22:29.763 --> 00:22:30.763
As for you,

00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:32.046
Man.

00:22:33.132 --> 00:22:34.366
I trust you the most.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.880
You

00:22:38.404 --> 00:22:39.677
have to be the leader

00:22:40.499 --> 00:22:41.546
in my place.

00:22:42.636 --> 00:22:43.966
Then where are you going?

00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:50.933
I'm going to follow my dream.

00:22:59.983 --> 00:23:01.584
What are we going to do about Ek?

00:23:03.687 --> 00:23:06.116
We can't practice without a drummer.

00:23:07.025 --> 00:23:09.024
What should we do, Win?

00:23:10.401 --> 00:23:11.669
Calm down.

00:23:11.693 --> 00:23:13.560
I'm trying to figure out a way.

00:23:14.075 --> 00:23:15.801
And why do you have to think?

00:23:15.825 --> 00:23:17.025
Because you're from the fut...

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.516
What's wrong with you guys?

00:23:21.714 --> 00:23:23.466
Biu just likes to talk nonsense.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.677
How many things do you know?

00:23:32.758 --> 00:23:33.758
Ek.

00:23:34.106 --> 00:23:35.654
My parents gave their permission.

00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:37.747
Really?

00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:44.658
Then let's start practicing.

00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:46.148
Let's do it?

00:23:46.173 --> 00:23:46.855
Go.

00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:47.879
Let's go.

00:23:49.454 --> 00:23:50.808
Where's my guitar?

00:23:59.914 --> 00:24:00.916
Everyone.

00:24:04.387 --> 00:24:05.481
Phop...

00:24:08.672 --> 00:24:09.832
is gone.

00:24:37.597 --> 00:24:39.357
I tried everything, Biu.

00:24:43.322 --> 00:24:45.035
But in the end, it's still the same.

00:24:50.528 --> 00:24:52.275
Would you two like to eat something?

00:24:53.066 --> 00:24:54.353
The rice soup is delicious.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.487
I can't really eat anything right now.

00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:10.144
I think...

00:25:10.733 --> 00:25:13.518
Phop has probably started
a rock band in heaven.

00:25:14.088 --> 00:25:15.834
And playing some awesome songs.

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:16.998
Yeah, true.

00:25:17.022 --> 00:25:18.800
Don't let Phop scream.

00:25:18.824 --> 00:25:20.312
Heaven would be in chaos.

00:25:25.924 --> 00:25:26.924
I think...

00:25:27.643 --> 00:25:29.202
soon Phop will probably

00:25:29.226 --> 00:25:30.781
be thrown down from heaven.

00:25:36.227 --> 00:25:37.904
Phop would probably be happy

00:25:38.422 --> 00:25:40.634
to look down and still
see you smiling, Win.

00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:46.433
Thanks, Lin.

00:25:50.207 --> 00:25:51.372
And don't worry.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.659
Phop's shop will stay the same.

00:25:53.683 --> 00:25:54.777
I promise.

00:25:58.482 --> 00:25:59.769
That's it.

00:25:59.795 --> 00:26:00.660
Good.

00:26:00.685 --> 00:26:01.632
Send it over.

00:26:01.656 --> 00:26:02.792
That's it.

00:26:02.816 --> 00:26:04.150
Slowly.

00:26:05.324 --> 00:26:06.691
Great.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.752
You promised the shop would stay the same.

00:26:11.776 --> 00:26:12.776
Oh.

00:26:12.933 --> 00:26:13.947
Yes.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.090
The shop is still here.

00:26:15.114 --> 00:26:17.022
But it's going to be a restaurant instead.

00:26:17.272 --> 00:26:18.672
Anyway, please come and support us.

00:26:19.032 --> 00:26:20.525
Bro, continue here.

00:26:21.272 --> 00:26:22.306
What should we do?

00:26:49.123 --> 00:26:50.295
Chai.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.228
Huh?

00:26:51.252 --> 00:26:53.135
Please put on the slippers.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:54.978
Oh.

00:26:55.002 --> 00:26:56.510
Sorry.

00:27:08.488 --> 00:27:09.541
So big.

00:27:24.755 --> 00:27:25.587
Hello.

00:27:25.611 --> 00:27:26.738
Hello.

00:27:28.817 --> 00:27:31.010
Practice hard, kids.

00:27:31.202 --> 00:27:33.059
Mom and I will be cheering for you.

00:27:33.505 --> 00:27:34.957
And if you need anything,

00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:36.671
just let us know.

00:27:37.868 --> 00:27:38.997
Thank you.

00:27:42.616 --> 00:27:44.401
Here, have some water first.

00:27:44.425 --> 00:27:45.801
Make yourselves comfortable.

00:27:50.175 --> 00:27:52.919
Great, this place is
very close to my house.

00:27:52.943 --> 00:27:54.751
I can come watch the practice every day.

00:27:57.146 --> 00:27:59.117
But you came to the old
place almost every day.

00:27:59.548 --> 00:28:00.768
You're very diligent.

00:28:00.813 --> 00:28:01.932
It's okay.

00:28:01.956 --> 00:28:03.820
I can get the travel expenses from my dad.

00:28:04.093 --> 00:28:06.217
Let me tell you, this is my turf.

00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:07.809
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:08.961
Should we go today, Nut?

00:28:12.286 --> 00:28:13.520
Today?

00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:15.267
Um...

00:28:18.442 --> 00:28:19.851
I can't go today.

00:28:20.586 --> 00:28:21.746
Oh, really?

00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:23.712
What a shame.

00:28:39.258 --> 00:28:40.478
Hey, Lin.

00:28:40.758 --> 00:28:43.267
I just got a new camera.

00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:44.439
I want to try it out.

00:28:44.463 --> 00:28:46.041
Can you be my model for some photos?

00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:47.238
Sure.

00:28:47.262 --> 00:28:48.404
Where?

00:29:01.926 --> 00:29:02.926
Hey, Nut.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.740
Can I ask you something?

00:29:05.375 --> 00:29:07.763
The reason you didn't go eat with Lin,

00:29:07.787 --> 00:29:09.061
where are you going?

00:29:11.114 --> 00:29:12.841
I have to eat with my family today.

00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:27.668
Okay, I'm ready.

00:29:28.793 --> 00:29:30.186
Where should I stand?

00:29:33.148 --> 00:29:38.368
Then, Lin, you can stand here.

00:29:42.328 --> 00:29:43.575
Here, right?

00:29:45.861 --> 00:29:49.429
1, 2, 3.

00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:56.695
1, 2, 3.

00:29:57.494 --> 00:29:59.135
Let me take a picture of you.

00:30:00.651 --> 00:30:02.140
How do I do it? Teach me.

00:30:02.532 --> 00:30:04.771
So when you shoot,

00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:06.537
you look here.

00:30:06.562 --> 00:30:07.598
And before you shoot,

00:30:07.622 --> 00:30:09.138
pull this all the way.

00:30:09.162 --> 00:30:10.289
And then press this button.

00:30:10.314 --> 00:30:11.502
But you have to wait for it to focus first.

00:30:11.526 --> 00:30:12.553
Then press down.

00:30:13.074 --> 00:30:14.547
Got it.

00:30:21.437 --> 00:30:22.639
Strike a pose.

00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:24.264
This isn't for an ID card.

00:30:29.473 --> 00:30:30.443
What was that?

00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:31.467
What?

00:30:32.775 --> 00:30:34.457
Hey, taking a candid shot like that

00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:35.671
makes my face look dumb.

00:30:35.695 --> 00:30:37.056
- Very dumb.
- No, no.

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:40.725
Let me take a vertical shot.

00:30:42.264 --> 00:30:43.477
Cute.

00:30:43.501 --> 00:30:45.483
I'll save this film to
take pictures of you.

00:30:45.507 --> 00:30:46.871
My face looks funny.

00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:48.036
Not funny.

00:30:49.093 --> 00:30:51.513
Go stand over there like before.

00:30:54.127 --> 00:30:55.536
Take a good one.

00:30:58.044 --> 00:31:00.411
1, 2, 3.

00:31:34.937 --> 00:31:35.553
Dad.

00:31:35.577 --> 00:31:36.450
Huh?

00:31:36.475 --> 00:31:38.172
I've finished washing the dishes.

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:39.738
Okay.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.451
The ideas are starting to flow.

00:31:43.275 --> 00:31:44.257
Um...

00:31:44.281 --> 00:31:45.601
I have something to ask you.

00:31:45.921 --> 00:31:47.483
Is something wrong lately?

00:31:48.309 --> 00:31:49.556
You seem

00:31:49.756 --> 00:31:51.193
not quite yourself.

00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:54.404
Well...

00:31:55.037 --> 00:31:56.890
I guess I feel guilty.

00:31:57.676 --> 00:31:58.956
I just feel that

00:31:59.422 --> 00:32:01.229
I haven't really done much for yo.

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:02.253
And

00:32:02.894 --> 00:32:05.200
I spend my time on useless things

00:32:06.313 --> 00:32:08.432
instead of spending more time with you.

00:32:10.647 --> 00:32:12.453
You talk like an old man.

00:32:12.478 --> 00:32:14.038
You want to do something for me, right?

00:32:14.464 --> 00:32:15.899
The piano.

00:32:15.923 --> 00:32:17.126
Play it for me.

00:32:26.031 --> 00:32:27.526
How does the melody go, Dad?

00:32:28.139 --> 00:32:30.195
That chord from before.

00:32:31.528 --> 00:32:32.845
Start here.

00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:35.020
Start with D flat.

00:32:35.044 --> 00:32:36.323
D flat.

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:40.041
Then go to F sharp.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.763
Um... here.

00:32:42.658 --> 00:32:44.626
And try, if you want to add some bass.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.171
It'll add more depth, Okay?

00:32:46.204 --> 00:32:47.344
- Okay.
- Alright, try it.

00:32:55.914 --> 00:32:57.161
Can I play too?

00:32:57.989 --> 00:32:59.074
Come on.

00:32:59.098 --> 00:33:00.328
Bring the guitar, son.

00:33:00.352 --> 00:33:01.413
Come on.

00:33:04.154 --> 00:33:06.186
The chord will be

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.192
D flat and then F sharp, Tim.

00:33:09.216 --> 00:33:11.172
Ready, 3, 4.

00:33:18.181 --> 00:33:19.534
Win, Win.

00:33:19.951 --> 00:33:21.138
I think...

00:33:21.405 --> 00:33:23.590
add an E flat minor

00:33:23.614 --> 00:33:24.843
before the F sharp?

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:27.411
I think we can try it.

00:33:27.435 --> 00:33:29.262
Try playing it for me.

00:33:29.287 --> 00:33:30.868
3, 4.

00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:40.163
Do you like it, Dad?

00:33:40.187 --> 00:33:41.100
It's good, I like it.

00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:43.328
Then I'll add it for you.

00:33:43.352 --> 00:33:44.662
It has more depth.

00:33:44.686 --> 00:33:47.248
E flat minor as a passing chord.

00:33:47.676 --> 00:33:49.276
OK, come on, one more time.

00:34:08.852 --> 00:34:09.852
Nut.

00:34:10.391 --> 00:34:12.132
Come home a little earlier tomorrow.

00:34:13.858 --> 00:34:15.058
Why?

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:18.001
Just hurry back, that's all.

00:34:55.938 --> 00:34:56.938
Mom.

00:34:57.488 --> 00:34:59.546
Can you check if the shirt is ironed yet?

00:35:01.775 --> 00:35:04.515
If it were any smoother,
it would be a marble tile.

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:07.026
That's enough. It's wasting electricity.

00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:09.740
Marble tile?

00:35:14.425 --> 00:35:15.828
Just a little more ironing, Mom.

00:35:23.627 --> 00:35:26.307
No more. It's wasting electricity.

00:35:28.644 --> 00:35:29.998
Not even a little bit more?

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.323
All done.

00:35:40.145 --> 00:35:41.418
Thanks you.

00:35:44.853 --> 00:35:46.346
Is this Nut's?

00:35:48.096 --> 00:35:49.323
Yeah.

00:35:49.449 --> 00:35:50.589
He returned it.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:52.912
Shit.

00:35:52.936 --> 00:35:53.907
You bring each other food

00:35:53.931 --> 00:35:55.639
and drinks almost every day.

00:35:55.663 --> 00:35:57.382
What's going on between you two?

00:35:58.608 --> 00:36:00.560
We're friends.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:01.850
Hey.

00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:03.343
What the heck?

00:36:03.702 --> 00:36:05.982
Why did you give way to Lin so easily?

00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:07.704
I think you and him

00:36:07.728 --> 00:36:09.308
still have more hope than me.

00:36:13.273 --> 00:36:14.888
Thank you so much, Biu.

00:36:14.912 --> 00:36:16.368
For trying to help me.

00:36:17.867 --> 00:36:19.525
But you don't have to.

00:36:19.716 --> 00:36:21.605
Hey, why are you talking like that?

00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:24.461
Well,

00:36:25.436 --> 00:36:26.493
honestly,

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.206
I just feel that

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.224
I don't want to steal their time anymore.

00:36:31.643 --> 00:36:33.129
What do you mean?

00:36:34.248 --> 00:36:35.476
What's going to happen?

00:36:37.368 --> 00:36:39.059
Let's just say when the time comes,

00:36:39.345 --> 00:36:40.612
I'll tell you.

00:36:40.763 --> 00:36:41.763
OK?

00:36:42.304 --> 00:36:43.624
Can't you tell me now?

00:36:43.649 --> 00:36:44.806
You can go now.

00:36:45.916 --> 00:36:48.045
Bro, get the money from Biu.

00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:49.829
Hey, Win!

00:36:51.642 --> 00:36:52.735
100 baht.

00:36:58.322 --> 00:36:59.579
Wow.

00:36:59.778 --> 00:37:01.345
Beautiful than I thought.

00:37:02.431 --> 00:37:03.711
You're underestimating me.

00:37:04.017 --> 00:37:05.285
No.

00:37:05.631 --> 00:37:07.111
But they're really beautiful.

00:37:07.578 --> 00:37:09.268
Like pictures in a magazine.

00:37:10.847 --> 00:37:12.429
It's because the lighting helped.

00:37:13.002 --> 00:37:14.282
And also...

00:37:16.279 --> 00:37:17.659
the model was good.

00:37:21.499 --> 00:37:22.859
Look at this.

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:24.359
Hey.

00:37:24.816 --> 00:37:26.545
I should have taken
these pictures out first.

00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:28.103
You don't have to.

00:37:29.123 --> 00:37:31.463
Then should we go take
pictures again this evening?

00:37:31.789 --> 00:37:33.209
The light should be nice.

00:37:34.072 --> 00:37:35.314
I don't think I can.

00:37:35.946 --> 00:37:37.586
I have to go to Nut's house this evening.

00:38:11.421 --> 00:38:13.080
The house is huge.

00:38:22.992 --> 00:38:24.276
Chai.

00:38:26.974 --> 00:38:29.522
You're dressed strangely today.

00:38:29.728 --> 00:38:31.448
I've never seen you dress like this before.

00:38:32.028 --> 00:38:34.450
I'm just dressing for the location.

00:38:44.415 --> 00:38:46.202
Where are you two dressed up to go?

00:38:47.695 --> 00:38:50.561
Chai said to dress for the location.

00:38:51.569 --> 00:38:52.569
Wow.

00:38:52.795 --> 00:38:54.494
Do you have to dress up this much?

00:38:56.576 --> 00:38:57.757
And

00:38:57.781 --> 00:38:59.538
did you get a new haircut?

00:39:01.143 --> 00:39:02.303
Well,

00:39:02.337 --> 00:39:04.756
Chai said he wanted us to look good today.

00:39:06.962 --> 00:39:08.388
This style

00:39:09.168 --> 00:39:10.481
is pretty cute too.

00:39:13.967 --> 00:39:15.508
Let's start practicing. Go.

00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:24.279
So cool.

00:39:24.512 --> 00:39:26.972
I think that last round was really good.

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:29.473
Tomorrow, just play like you practiced.

00:39:31.112 --> 00:39:32.841
There will be a lot of people tomorrow

00:39:32.865 --> 00:39:34.739
and I won't be able
to play like I practiced.

00:39:36.184 --> 00:39:37.400
Tomorrow, just play

00:39:37.424 --> 00:39:39.064
without paying attention to the audience.

00:39:39.211 --> 00:39:41.132
How many times have you practiced this set?

00:39:42.873 --> 00:39:45.140
We believe you can do it, Ek.

00:39:46.759 --> 00:39:48.041
If we get through tomorrow,

00:39:48.065 --> 00:39:49.465
all that's left is the final round.

00:39:49.763 --> 00:39:51.078
If we can practice like this,

00:39:51.453 --> 00:39:53.213
I'm confident that we'll
win no matter what.

00:39:54.502 --> 00:39:55.986
Hey, guys.

00:39:56.658 --> 00:39:58.145
See that up there?

00:39:59.775 --> 00:40:00.775
Over there.

00:40:00.984 --> 00:40:02.875
That's the best bassist award.

00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:05.754
I'm going to go get it
for you all to admire.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.555
If you really win best bassist,

00:40:08.675 --> 00:40:10.826
I'll treat you to your favorite Mookrata.

00:40:10.858 --> 00:40:11.967
You said it.

00:40:12.504 --> 00:40:13.592
Then I want the big set.

00:40:14.105 --> 00:40:15.925
You eat so much.

00:40:18.765 --> 00:40:19.847
How about this instead?

00:40:19.871 --> 00:40:22.558
I think no matter who wins an award,

00:40:22.824 --> 00:40:24.358
we should all go celebrate together.

00:40:24.951 --> 00:40:26.161
My treat.

00:40:27.316 --> 00:40:28.269
Then

00:40:28.294 --> 00:40:31.237
Biu, you're buying the drinks, okay?

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.181
Give an inch and you'll take a mile.

00:40:35.353 --> 00:40:36.780
Let's pack up and go home.

00:40:46.972 --> 00:40:48.074
Nut.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.300
After this, want to go
get something to eat?

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.456
Sorry.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:56.857
I have to go home early today.

00:41:12.535 --> 00:41:14.129
Do you still like to eat this?

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:17.439
Thanks, Lin.

00:41:21.272 --> 00:41:22.608
Seeing Lin and Nut

00:41:22.632 --> 00:41:24.172
become close again like before

00:41:24.379 --> 00:41:25.781
makes me miss the old days.

00:41:27.356 --> 00:41:28.561
I know, right?

00:41:28.585 --> 00:41:29.881
But it's a shame

00:41:29.905 --> 00:41:30.874
that next year,

00:41:30.898 --> 00:41:32.753
Lin will be going to study in England.

00:41:37.057 --> 00:41:38.197
Really?

00:41:38.423 --> 00:41:39.525
That's great then.

00:41:39.556 --> 00:41:41.231
I was also just thinking about sending Nut

00:41:41.255 --> 00:41:42.782
to study abroad.

00:41:44.101 --> 00:41:45.477
Should they go together?

00:41:47.066 --> 00:41:48.021
Sure.

00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:49.573
Lin will have a friend with her then.

00:41:57.184 --> 00:41:58.466
Um...

00:41:59.484 --> 00:42:00.784
So...

00:42:03.025 --> 00:42:05.380
But Nut wants to be a musician

00:42:05.404 --> 00:42:07.365
and have a band here
in Thailand, doesn't he?

00:42:09.239 --> 00:42:10.261
Lin.

00:42:10.568 --> 00:42:12.488
Don't be so serious about that.

00:42:12.661 --> 00:42:15.974
That music thing is just a dream.

00:42:16.054 --> 00:42:17.456
It can't be a real career.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.774
Nut knows that well.

00:42:27.052 --> 00:42:28.240
Thank you.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.761
Wow, you really know what I like.

00:42:33.602 --> 00:42:34.942
Thank you.

00:42:36.415 --> 00:42:39.344
Tomorrow is the competition day, right?

00:42:39.735 --> 00:42:40.798
Yes.

00:42:41.798 --> 00:42:43.211
So, you two,

00:42:43.423 --> 00:42:44.813
are you ready?

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.801
We're fully prepared.

00:42:46.825 --> 00:42:48.769
We've practiced very hard.

00:42:48.793 --> 00:42:50.353
We'll definitely get to the next round.

00:42:51.431 --> 00:42:52.551
By the way,

00:42:52.986 --> 00:42:54.676
Chai, you look cute dressed like this.

00:42:55.408 --> 00:42:57.198
You look cool and smart.

00:42:57.451 --> 00:42:59.998
You look very handsome today.

00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:00.750
Thank you.

00:43:00.774 --> 00:43:02.374
I've never seen this look on you before.

00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:03.805
Very cool.

00:43:04.066 --> 00:43:05.496
I forgot to ask.

00:43:05.642 --> 00:43:07.188
Coming to eat at our house,

00:43:07.212 --> 00:43:09.325
how's the food? Is it okay?

00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:10.805
The food is delicious.

00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:12.225
Very delicious.

00:43:12.871 --> 00:43:14.089
I miss my mom.

00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:19.084
If that's the case, next time,

00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:20.886
Chai, you should invite your mother

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.131
to come have dinner with us.

00:43:23.566 --> 00:43:24.674
Yes, exactly.

00:43:25.124 --> 00:43:25.868
Sure.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.147
Yeah, bring her along.

00:43:27.794 --> 00:43:29.967
Ek, serve some food for Chai.

00:43:32.015 --> 00:43:33.443
The eggs are fine, that's it.

00:43:40.735 --> 00:43:41.745
Mr. Chai.

00:43:41.769 --> 00:43:43.816
Ma'am give you this pork leg.

00:43:44.975 --> 00:43:46.004
Thank you very much.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:47.809
This is a delicacy.

00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:48.941
Thank you.

00:43:57.741 --> 00:43:59.063
Tonight,

00:43:59.693 --> 00:44:00.950
get some sleep.

00:44:02.277 --> 00:44:04.487
I'm not sure if I'll be
able to sleep tonight.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:06.672
Because I'll definitely be very excited.

00:44:08.453 --> 00:44:09.960
If you're excited,

00:44:10.707 --> 00:44:11.881
then tonight,

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.788
try closing your eyes

00:44:13.812 --> 00:44:16.257
and counting geese one by one.

00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:19.556
1, 2.

00:44:21.535 --> 00:44:22.598
Wait a minute.

00:44:23.158 --> 00:44:24.304
Counting geese?

00:44:25.495 --> 00:44:26.901
Don't people usually count sheep?

00:44:27.245 --> 00:44:29.555
No, I'm going to count geese.

00:44:29.861 --> 00:44:32.208
Geese can fly over fences too.

00:44:32.695 --> 00:44:33.594
Okay.

00:44:33.618 --> 00:44:35.498
Tonight I'll sleep while counting geese.

00:44:37.399 --> 00:44:39.166
And tomorrow, tell me

00:44:39.711 --> 00:44:40.926
how many you counted.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.508
Okay.

00:44:43.533 --> 00:44:45.713
I'm going. Good luck tomorrow.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.387
Okay.

00:44:51.048 --> 00:44:52.196
Chai.

00:44:53.315 --> 00:44:54.761
Drive safely.

00:44:56.016 --> 00:44:57.136
Thanks.

00:44:58.002 --> 00:44:59.153
And also,

00:44:59.525 --> 00:45:01.053
tell me how many geese you counted.

00:45:01.085 --> 00:45:02.113
Okay.

00:45:43.288 --> 00:45:44.635
Beautiful than I thought.

00:45:46.215 --> 00:45:48.165
But I feel like

00:45:48.189 --> 00:45:49.720
something's missing.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.760
Why?

00:45:52.519 --> 00:45:53.961
Is a picture missing?

00:46:58.346 --> 00:46:59.360
Mom.

00:47:02.193 --> 00:47:03.193
Here.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.461
Pork leg with skin,
just the way you like it.

00:47:07.158 --> 00:47:08.766
Oh, thanks.

00:47:09.039 --> 00:47:10.232
After you finish eating,

00:47:10.256 --> 00:47:11.776
just leave it here. I'll come wash it.

00:47:13.015 --> 00:47:14.271
Oh, Chai.

00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:17.435
Tomorrow, good luck.

00:47:24.774 --> 00:47:27.160
Leave it here, I'll do it tomorrow.

00:47:46.461 --> 00:47:48.522
It's okay, go and rest.

00:47:48.546 --> 00:47:49.934
I'll clear it myself.

00:47:50.107 --> 00:47:51.187
Okay, Mom.

00:47:52.597 --> 00:47:53.670
Nut.

00:47:55.596 --> 00:47:57.003
Tomorrow,

00:47:57.344 --> 00:47:58.484
I'm taking you to apply

00:47:58.508 --> 00:47:59.868
for a scholarship to study abroad.

00:48:00.063 --> 00:48:01.388
Lin's father recommended it.

00:48:01.568 --> 00:48:02.988
Get your documents ready.

00:48:03.438 --> 00:48:04.438
Dad.

00:48:04.663 --> 00:48:07.984
- But tomorrow...
- If you're going to talk about your useless band,

00:48:08.402 --> 00:48:09.604
I don't want to hear it.

00:48:10.318 --> 00:48:11.545
I'm not going.

00:48:11.885 --> 00:48:13.365
Have you ever asked me, Dad,

00:48:14.004 --> 00:48:15.864
what I really want?

00:48:17.355 --> 00:48:18.936
Well, if what you want

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.328
doesn't make your future better,

00:48:21.667 --> 00:48:23.134
why should I care?

00:48:23.717 --> 00:48:24.712
Dad.

00:48:24.736 --> 00:48:26.570
Go get your documents ready.

00:48:31.168 --> 00:48:32.255
No.

00:48:40.761 --> 00:48:41.759
Tim, give it a sniff.

00:48:41.783 --> 00:48:43.451
How is it? Does it smell good?

00:48:43.876 --> 00:48:45.235
Here you go, Dad.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.469
Here, Tim.

00:48:48.261 --> 00:48:49.768
Vegetables again?

00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:51.837
It's good that you're eating vegetables,

00:48:51.861 --> 00:48:52.653
you're old dad.

00:48:52.686 --> 00:48:54.565
Eating only fried and oily food isn't good.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:57.343
Old? I'm only 49.

00:48:57.695 --> 00:48:59.876
49? Up to 50.

00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:01.825
Yes, my lovely son.

00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:03.990
So lovely, cursing your dad.

00:49:08.286 --> 00:49:09.776
Win.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.749
Can I have some omelet, please?

00:49:12.343 --> 00:49:13.579
Win.

00:49:13.603 --> 00:49:15.624
Can I have some omelet, please?

00:49:16.523 --> 00:49:18.497
Didn't you just have
an omelet this morning?

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.284
But Tim likes it.

00:49:20.637 --> 00:49:22.664
But Vithoon likes it.

00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:26.960
Okay, Tim. Okay, Vithoon.

00:49:27.427 --> 00:49:28.782
How many eggs?

00:49:28.806 --> 00:49:29.795
2, please.

00:49:29.819 --> 00:49:31.473
Plus 2, please.

00:49:34.256 --> 00:49:35.957
Win.

00:49:35.988 --> 00:49:37.989
Can I have some fried chicken, please?

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.348
Win.

00:49:39.372 --> 00:49:41.501
Can I have some fried chicken, please?

00:49:41.936 --> 00:49:43.874
That's enough, both of you.

00:49:47.148 --> 00:49:48.641
At least we get an omelet.

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.110
Thank you.

00:50:05.031 --> 00:50:07.395
Why is there chicken now that Nut is here?

00:50:07.703 --> 00:50:08.512
Yeah.

00:50:08.536 --> 00:50:11.065
Why is there chicken now that Nut is here?

00:50:11.413 --> 00:50:13.805
Because Win knows that
I likes to eat fried chicken.

00:50:14.421 --> 00:50:15.963
But Tim likes it too.

00:50:15.987 --> 00:50:19.106
Oh, yes, but Vithoon likes it too.

00:50:21.215 --> 00:50:23.801
Then should we share it?

00:50:24.181 --> 00:50:26.355
That's great.

00:50:27.753 --> 00:50:29.560
Tim, you eat first.

00:50:30.093 --> 00:50:31.499
Okay.

00:50:31.859 --> 00:50:33.705
Fried chicken, sir.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:36.107
Thank you very much, Nut.

00:50:36.131 --> 00:50:37.291
Thank you.

00:50:47.371 --> 00:50:48.371
So,

00:50:48.497 --> 00:50:50.525
didn't you just have dinner at Lin's house?

00:50:54.878 --> 00:50:56.323
I'll tell you later.

00:51:01.705 --> 00:51:02.948
Your dad

00:51:03.247 --> 00:51:04.387
hasn't changed at all.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.807
You talk like you've known
my dad for a long time.

00:51:15.102 --> 00:51:16.652
Actually, it has been a long time.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:19.603
Just a few months?

00:51:31.328 --> 00:51:33.229
I really want to show my dad

00:51:34.903 --> 00:51:36.940
that playing music can be a career.

00:51:40.179 --> 00:51:41.527
If you want to prove it,

00:51:43.013 --> 00:51:44.773
there's only one way, isn't there?

00:51:54.487 --> 00:51:55.708
We have to win the competition.

did we win the competition?

00:52:22.241 --> 00:52:23.368
No.

00:52:25.233 --> 00:52:26.496
If I already know that

00:52:26.521 --> 00:52:28.661
in the end, it'll turn out the same way,

00:52:28.959 --> 00:52:31.136
why should we even try?

00:52:33.003 --> 00:52:34.410
I'm still hoping.

00:52:35.116 --> 00:52:36.203
Hoping for what?

00:52:38.062 --> 00:52:39.062
Hoping that

00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:40.710
even though we already know

00:52:40.734 --> 00:52:42.341
how the destination will end,

00:52:43.025 --> 00:52:45.560

In the end, we still lost, right?

00:53:38.255 --> 00:53:39.930
Just the fact that I get to be here,

00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:41.538
get to be with you guys,

00:53:43.735 --> 00:53:45.374
get to see the person I love again.

00:53:46.341 --> 00:53:48.064
That alone makes it different from before.

00:54:11.266 --> 00:54:13.175
(Next Episode) Hey, why do
you suddenly want to go camping?

00:54:13.199 --> 00:54:15.205
Look for inspiration to write a song.

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:16.401
Because in the final round,

00:54:16.425 --> 00:54:17.825
we have to use a new original song.

00:54:17.938 --> 00:54:18.987
What were you thinking?

00:54:19.011 --> 00:54:20.982
Coming all this way to celebrate a victory.

00:54:21.315 --> 00:54:22.848
Tired.

00:54:22.872 --> 00:54:24.090
But it's worth it, right?

00:54:24.115 --> 00:54:25.297
Of course.

00:54:26.134 --> 00:54:28.071
I used to think that I
wanted to have a band,

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:30.157
and invite everyone to go camping,

00:54:30.314 --> 00:54:32.034
and eat Mookrata like this for a long time.

00:54:32.176 --> 00:54:33.164
Now that you're here,

00:54:33.194 --> 00:54:34.176
have you gotten more

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.525
inspiration to write songs?

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.530
Hey, you.

00:54:36.554 --> 00:54:37.728
Can I ask you something?

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:40.975
20 years later, Lin and Nut...
