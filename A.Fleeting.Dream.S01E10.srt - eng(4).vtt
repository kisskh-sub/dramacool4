00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:15.078
Miss, a ticket sent by Madam Hou.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.519
She said she wants you to attend.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:17.799
Watch a movie?

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.360
Why is there only one ticket?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.358
Where's Yuze's ticket?

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.399
Second Master...

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.399
Mainly, the audience is all ladies.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.119
It might be inconvenient for him to go.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.000
It's okay, I got it.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.439
Second Master.

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:46.519
Has the ticket been sent?

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.999
Yes.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.039
Second Master.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.879
Since returning to Hu City,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.919
you've been busy with Miss Du's matter.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.999
There's still no clue
about the antidote.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.439
Why don't we take advantage of Pei Yujie
going out and sneak into his room...

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.520
Alright.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.880
I can handle this.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.679
Don't worry.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.960
The traveling doctor
asked me to remind you

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.118
there's only half a year left.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.839
This time the dosage is increased.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.480
It might be a bit uncomfortable
to take it.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.400
I got it.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.160
You go ahead.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.020
(Heroic Spirit Lasts Forever

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.360
Hey.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.519
What happened at home?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.319
Miss Du, there's been a burglary.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.879
Go that way, you search over there.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.800
Okay.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.038
Wen Yuan, what are you doing here?

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.199
Go check over there!

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.120
Alright.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.479
Someone! Something happened!

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.600
Over there!

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.680
Miss Du.

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.758
Someone just passed by there,

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.558
and scared me, go check quickly.

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:11.519
Chase!

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.640
Still not coming out?

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.959
Miss Du, you didn't go to the cinema?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.800
Do you take me for a fool?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.038
What exactly happened?
How could you get hurt like this?

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.838
I sneaked into Pei Yujie's study room

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.479
and was accidentally discovered.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.159
Why did you go to his study room?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.239
His study room is heavily guarded
and there are many people on watch.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.959
Why did Yuze take the risk

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.479
and let you go there alone?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.400
I acted without Second Master knowing.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.880
Miss Du, please don't tell him.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.078
Why?

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.199
Tell the truth.

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.119
Not telling, huh?

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.479
I'll go ask him right now.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.880
You can't go see him.

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.439
No, I mean, I...

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.959
I'm badly hurt.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.679
Could you please

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.118
help me get out?

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.479
You're hiding something from me.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.439
Did something happen to Yuze?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.440
Tell me.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.239
No, no way he...

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.360
Go check over there!

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.080
Leave through the back door.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.640
Hurry!

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.800
Pei Yuze.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.240
What's wrong?

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.358
Why are you back?

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:41.719
Are you feeling unwell?

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.000
I'll call a doctor.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.080
Don't!

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.480
I'm fine.

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:52.119
You...

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.199
Just a little tired.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:57.839
A nap will do.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.240
Pei Yuze.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.960
Pei Yuze.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.280
How are you?

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.239
Don't worry, it's fine now.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.199
Just a stomachache.
I'll be fine after taking some medicine.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.160
How long are you planning
to keep deceiving me?

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.399
Or is it

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:53.479
that you don't trust me at all
in your heart?

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:54.798
Then what am I?

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:56.439
Am I just a pawn to you?

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.719
So I don't need to know anything, right?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.520
If that's the case,

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:02.239
then I'll leave.

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:06.879
Don't go.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.520
I'll tell you everything.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.120
I grew up in the ancestral house.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.280
When I was 16 years old,

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:19.559
my father fell gravely ill
and passed away.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.480
I then moved to Hu City
to live with Pei Yujie.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.519
Before my father died, he left a will

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.239
that letting me inherit
the head of the family.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.400
But not long after,

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.399
I suddenly vomited blood and fainted.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.640
So,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.920
you were really sick.

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.199
At first, it was thought
to be an epidemic.

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.479
But after long investigation,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.160
no treatment could be found.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.560
The doctors even notified
the family to prepare my funeral.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.598
Later, I happened to meet
a traveling doctor from Southwest China.

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:53.959
He suspected

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.919
that my food had been poisoned.

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.279
Did someone poison you?

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:02.758
Thanks to this traveling doctor making
medicine for me for over the years,

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.479
to suppress the toxin in my body.

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.599
Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive today.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.800
So the pills I discovered before

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.639
were medicines you used
to suppress the toxin.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.558
When the toxin isn't active,

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:19.479
my body is like any normal person's.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.439
I pretended to be sick

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.240
to make Pei Yujie lower his guard,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.200
to make him think

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.798
I didn't know I was poisoned.

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:30.999
That's why you gave up
the family head position

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.440
and sought doctors everywhere,

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:36.279
while Pei Yujie naturally
became the new head of the family.

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:38.759
Truly wicked.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.880
The traveling doctor's medicine

00:07:41.359 --> 00:07:43.159
only suppresses the toxin in my body,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.640
but cannot cure it completely.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.559
But now my body

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:49.879
is increasingly resistant.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.800
We must find the antidote
within six months.

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:56.039
Otherwise...

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.680
Otherwise...

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.560
You'll die?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.598
This poison is strong,

00:08:10.599 --> 00:08:12.519
but not entirely useless.

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:15.719
See, now ordinary poisons can't hurt me.

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:17.479
I can say

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.320
I'm immune to most toxins.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.800
Pei Yuze.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.040
We had a deal before.

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.199
You help me take revenge,

00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:34.759
I'll help you achieve what you want.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.040
We

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.559
can find the antidote together.

00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:41.719
You'll be fine.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.879
(Pei Residence)

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.400
The steward said there was a burglary
in the study room last night.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.479
Though the thief wasn't caught,
fortunately nothing important was lost,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.519
and no one was hurt.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.519
What a relief.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.840
Yes, truly a foolish thief.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.678
Why steal anywhere else, but the study room?

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:05.158
No wonder he returned empty-handed.

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:07.319
Yuze, don't you think so?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.960
Indeed, a foolish thief.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.680
The dishes are ready.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.198
What a treat today.

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:16.079
Yao hasn't cooked in a long time.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.920
Uncle Yuze, Miss Du, taste this.

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.439
Yao suddenly cooking,

00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:23.278
is it some good news about Xueshan?

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.838
Uncle Yuze, don't joke.

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:26.238
I just felt like it.

00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:27.719
No good news at all.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.040
This is delicious.

00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:42.159
How careless.
I'll take you to apply medicine.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.199
It's fine, let's eat first.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:55.599
Here.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.840
There's so much scallion in this soup.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.198
Yao hasn't cooked in a long time,
he really forgot I don't like scallions.

00:10:04.199 --> 00:10:07.279
Someone else likes them.

00:10:08.239 --> 00:10:10.999
Xueshan, what are you talking about?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.040
Nothing.

00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:13.919
Uncle Yuze, Aunt Youmeng, you eat first.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.120
I don't want to eat.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.319
Xueshan seems angry.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.880
Yao.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.600
As her fiancé,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.400
aren't you going to check on her?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.960
Yuze.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.600
Yao says this is delicious.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.480
You love scallions.

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:53.999
Xueshan.

00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:55.719
Stop messing around!

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:57.719
Messing around?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.198
Jiang Yao, all these years,

00:11:01.199 --> 00:11:03.358
you never forgot Lian Xinruo.

00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:05.080
You think I didn't know?

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:07.158
I thought as long as I stayed
by your side,

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:08.039
one day,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.360
I could replace her place in your heart.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.919
But I never expected

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.840
even that frivolous woman Du Youmeng,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.678
just because she has the same face
as Lian Xinruo,

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:19.559
she could occupy your heart.

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:23.238
Xueshan.

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:24.718
It's not what you think.

00:11:24.719 --> 00:11:25.758
Wake up!

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:27.039
Lian Xinruo is already dead!

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.360
Shut up!

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.080
Sorry.

00:11:40.319 --> 00:11:42.159
I shouldn't have lost
my temper with you.

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:45.799
Xueshan.

00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:47.719
Just remember one thing.

00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:49.678
We're about to get married.

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:52.039
This will not change.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.040
Second Master,
I investigated this warehouse.

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:20.079
It was renovated five years ago,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.358
and has mostly been empty.

00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:23.358
Occasionally some goods
from Jiang City come in.

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:26.039
The most recent was yesterday.

00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:27.719
Five years ago?

00:12:28.599 --> 00:12:30.119
There was a small window at the back.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.399
I pried it open a few days ago
when no one was guarding it.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.040
We can enter from there.

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:36.759
The inside situation is still unclear.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.119
We'll use a diversion.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.079
I'll go with you.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.440
No need, stay here, go.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.439
Yuze.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.640
Stop!

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:05.678
This is private property.

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:06.919
What are you doing?

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.720
Hello, sirs.

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:09.879
It's like this.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.719
My car

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.959
broke down halfway,

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.080
and fell into a pit.

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:15.359
I wanted some help.

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:17.198
I wonder if you two

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:18.399
could help.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.638
Don't worry,
I won't let you come for nothing.

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:23.519
Then I'll go with you and see.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.399
What are you doing?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.319
If anything happens to this batch,
don't think you can stay in Hu City.

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:29.158
Stop talking, get lost!

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:31.719
No, my car is right there.

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:33.198
It won't take long.

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:34.718
Please, two sirs, make it convenient.

00:13:34.719 --> 00:13:36.679
More talk and I'll shoot you!

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.919
Out in the wilderness,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.999
he suddenly appears.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.400
Isn't that suspicious?

00:13:47.319 --> 00:13:48.319
Stop!

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.720
