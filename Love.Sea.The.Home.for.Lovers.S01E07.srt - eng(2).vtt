(I promise I'll cheer you up!)

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.900
"Love Sea: The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 7)

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.280
That annoying person is back.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.630
Back again?

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.300
She's been clinging to Ai since before.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.540
- From a few years ago...
- Ah...

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.440
Sorry.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.240
The rest

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.380
I'll wait for him to say it himself.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.430
Wait until he trusts me

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.640
to tell me personally.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.030
Kaishin, there's one thing

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.230
can I ask you for a favor?

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.950
What is it?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.580
You and Ai...

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.490
don't let your relationship stop at just a contract.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.470
You could keep asking.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.200
I'm used to it anyway.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.320
Good morning, Ai-san.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.780
Want coffee?

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.140
When I was little

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.160
people asked about why my parents divorced.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.570
When I grew up, they asked if I was gay.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.160
People were always prying into these things.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.770
Even after becoming a writer

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.420
people hear about me from others.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.100
I feel like...

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.300
you're mad about something else.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.510
When did you exchange contact with Himeka?

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.860
On the first day.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.130
She said to tell her if I needed anything.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.850
That woman...

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.080
But...

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.770
from now on, I'll ask you directly about you.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.470
Breakfast.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.720
What do you want?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.040
No need.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.890
Last night...

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.630
I ate a lot.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.500
Thanks for treating me.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.890
That person from yesterday...

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.610
is...

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.540
my cousin Rin.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.200
Rin's mom and my mom are sisters.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.340
But they've always been hostile toward our family.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.980
My mom was good at making money.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.750
Including this house

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.640
the properties under my name...

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.470
originally all belonged to my mom.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.070
My aunt was always...

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.170
trying to belittle my mom.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.120
Her daughter Rin is the same.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.250
Just to attack me

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.510
she became a writer.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.640
She's also a writer?

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.670
Various kinds.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.510
Speaking of which.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.670
I don't know what's to envy.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.970
They have everything our family doesn't.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.090
Including a good father.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.210
My dad... he is...

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.000
a worthless gold digger.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.850
To clean up his messy affairs with women

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.220
mom spent a fortune.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.200
In the end...

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.520
So the scar on your head...

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.900
You noticed it already, huh?

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.270
Domestic violence was routine.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.260
On the last day

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.400
he hit me with a bottle with all his strength.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.190
My mom collapsed and cried.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.040
Dad yelled "shut up, be quiet"

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.290
screaming at her.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.500
Mom gave dad money and the house

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.090
even after cutting ties with us

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.020
those relatives still...

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.070
look down on us

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.180
constantly slandering us.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.170
Rin grew up seeing all this

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.470
and sees me as a thorn.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.430
If I ran for student council

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.690
she would run too.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.650
If I studied abroad, so did she.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.160
Lost in novel writing and accused me of plagiarism.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.670
I can't understand...

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.430
why she's so obsessed with beating me.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.850
For me,

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.160
if I could have a happy family like theirs.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.120
I would give up everything.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.280
What more do they want?

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.120
Does someone in my family have to die...

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.490
before they're finally satisfied?

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.420
Ai-san.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.450
It's okay to cry if you want to.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.950
I won't cry.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.440
It was so long ago.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.690
Then...

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.480
that's okay too.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.590
Let me ask one question.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.690
What?

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.070
Can I hug you?

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.170
I didn't say you could.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.290
Then...

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.800
You can deduct it from my salary as punishment.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.570
I'll deduct your salary.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.140
Deduct it all.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.620
Thank you.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.600
Aren't you answering?

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.610
I don't bother.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.610
It's rare for Fumi to have free time.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.270
If I didn't know Teacher Ai was into "that side"...

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.190
seeing you two are together and so close.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.610
Recently there's a replacement.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.620
Oh?

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.410
So that's why you're listless?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.710
Huh?

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.150
Am I listless?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.080
You usually talk enthusiastically about novels or actresses you support.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.770
Yeah, like Himeka Ui.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.940
Himeka-san?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.820
Why are you at the office?

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.380
Are you crying?

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.140
Oh no, bad reviews again?

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.800
Today...

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.170
I filmed a scene about grandma's death.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.780
And...

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.600
haven't gotten out of that emotion.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.260
That feeling

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.130
reminded me of when she actually passed away.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.190
But...

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.950
I don't want anyone other than you to think...

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.860
I'm an actress who can't control her emotions.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.080
What can I do for you?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.840
Hold me tight.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.430
Huh?

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.400
Please.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.110
Feeling any better?

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.500
No.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.380
What should I do...?

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.330
Don't avoid me.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.960
I'm not avoiding you.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.970
Promise me.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.990
Say you won't avoid me.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.670
I miss grandma so much.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.170
When I held her hand...

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.030
she'd squeeze back with weakly.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.370
Be good!

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.940
Himeka-san, I promise.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.440
I won't avoid you.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.510
So please, don't cry anymore.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Mina.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.500
Want to get ice cream on Sunday?

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.860
Yeah! By car?

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.550
Yes

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.690
I ask dad if it's okay when he comes to pick me up.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.730
Yay! Great!

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.790
Thank you.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.170
What's wrong?

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.310
My Grandpa...

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.000
Can you ask your dad to drive to the back of school?

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:24.830
And give me a ride?

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.390
Thank you.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.420
Let's go.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.020
Mina.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.560
Ai.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.140
Your sudden call surprised me.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.030
Here.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.730
Come on in.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.110
This is the guy I live with.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.010
Kaishin.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.590
Hello.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.440
So, is he Uncle Ai's type?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.290
Uncle Ai...

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.670
Good height, good build...

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.010
Tanned skin, too...

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.880
Hmm, barely passing.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.170
As for looks...

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.330
Full marks.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.700
Uncle Ai.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.300
Little adult.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.490
You can't compare me to when Ai was a kid

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.390
I've been using smartphone since I was in diapers.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.900
Maybe I should ask your mom to set usage limits.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.270
Well, I'll go read Ai's novel.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.810
So...

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.240
Is that person your boyfriend?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.110
What a cliché punishment.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.240
If you're here for allowance, behave.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.790
Something wrong?

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.320
Earlier...

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.510
On my way home from school...

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.910
I saw Grandpa.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.960
But I ran away immediately, he didn't see me.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.040
Ai.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.060
Did you tell your mom?

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.580
- We have to tell her.
- No.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.440
She'll get paranoid again.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.150
Bodyguards following is annoying.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.200
- But it's to protect you...
- I know.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.500
Then...

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.140
I'll start picking you up from tomorrow after school.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.530
Huh?

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.230
But...

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.330
My mom said Ai is terrified of Grandpa.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.730
She told you that, too...

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.980
Can't your secretary do it?

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.840
No.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.100
If something happen, she's not strong enough.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.380
I...

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.750
I'm strong enough.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.790
Just say I'm hired by Ai-san...

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.720
your mom should agree.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.560
If Mom worries we can stay on the phone.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.840
No.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.310
Why not?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.260
It might be dangerous.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.210
I want to protect people whom you treasure.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.160
Ahem.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.120
This isn't just about you two.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.080
You have to pass my test first.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.260
Ai.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.000
Could you give us a moment?

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.330
So.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.010
Do you like Ai?

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.150
Well...

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.050
Is this a test?

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.140
Don't answer a question with a question.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.720
So do you?

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.710
Do you like him?

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.250
Do you love him?

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.060
He's quite handsome.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.750
And cute.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.640
And?

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:46.660
Anything else?

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.510
I feel bad hiding things from a child.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.430
Do you want to know?

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.380
The reason we're together...

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.440
The reason?

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.320
He pays me to be with him.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.540
Do you understand what that means?

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.160
Why?

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.330
Ai...

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.090
did the same thing as Grandma.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.310
But I don't want money.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.530
Then why did you take the job?

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.450
To make him love me.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.640
No, to be more clear.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.180
To make him

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.310
have no choice but to love me.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.850
Actually...

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.100
I read Ai's novel.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:42.660
It was a very...

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.770
very lonely story.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.900
I want Ai's own story...

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.890
can have someone who won't make him feel alone.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.240
And I want it to have a happy ending.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:55.720
Mina-chan.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.710
Please, help me be that person.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.630
I'm confident I can do it.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.010
I like people with guts.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.430
You passed.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.010
Just call me Mina

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.520
I'll call you "Uncle Kaishin".

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.400
That way, I can call you that no matter what happens.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.840
Are you really in sixth grade?

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.800
[4 years ago: Transfer 1 million yen to Dad]
(Message: Stop calling sister)

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.900
[3 years ago: Transfer 3 million yen to Dad]
(Message: This is the last time)

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.100
[Transfer 1 million yen to Dad]
(Message: Money given, stop bothering us)

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.000
(Message read)

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.260
I'm back.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.890
Welcome back.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.310
Thanks for meeting my sister.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.630
The route home is simple.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.630
Leave the pickup and drop-off to me starting tomorrow.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.420
Are you okay

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:44.990
about your father?

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.340
I'm not okay at all.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.460
Can I hug you?

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.840
It's okay.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.230
I'm here for you.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:13.880
Thank you.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.360
Kaishin.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.560
Thank you for being here

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.210
and for taking care of Mina.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.710
It's nothing.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.700
You're very honest today.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.020
Is this returning the favor?

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.030
Do whatever you want.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.460
I'm yours.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.260
Um...

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.060
Isn't this a little too intense?

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:50.680
Seriously.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.580
It's an Ai Rakumoto's work after all.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.550
But it must be weird
to watch your significant other's work.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:57.750
I'm...

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.060
just the driver.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.370
You can drop the act at this point.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.410
Good work today.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.840
You too.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.870
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.470
Hey, wha-wha-what...

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.230
What are you doing?

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.820
I'm going to change clothes.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.550
- Heave-ho!
- Wait.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.680
Please go by yourself.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.990
I can't get the zipper.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.730
Hurry.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.150
People will be here any second.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.620
Get inside...

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.250
Figure it out yourself.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.290
I told you I can't reach it!

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.630
Look.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:54.860
Hurry.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.600
You little pervert.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.330
Just get changed...

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.830
What are you so shy about?

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.010
We're all girls.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.540
Please close the shield.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.990
So hurt, I feel being hated.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.460
I do hate you.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:34.920
You're always teasing me...

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.710
Because you're so fun to tease.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.430
What is fun to tease?

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.290
Everything about you is.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.750
It's okay if Fumi hates me.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.780
I like you.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.300
Huh?!

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.330
Let's go back.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:05.780
Clothes changed.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.340
The bags, checked.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.700
Just leave it.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.290
We're coming back tomorrow anyway.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:11.950
I'm not coming.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.690
It's teacher Ai's event tomorrow.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.260
Event?

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.360
Back when I was a student

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.530
as a reader

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.870
as a fan

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.600
the first time I saw Teacher Ai in person

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.040
was at a book fair.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.900
(Celebrating TV adaptation!
Ai Rakumoto Signing Event)

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.930
- This is today's booth.
- Okay.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.160
Teacher Ai

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.010
we're counting on you today.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.220
Thank you.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.270
Regarding the venue precautions...

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:40.670
Yes, I'll handle it.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.600
This way, please.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.410
First time seeing you look so much like a real author.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:50.700
Hmm?

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.200
Wait.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:56.800
Fix it.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.430
Hey, hurry and fix it.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.650
You look handsome now.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.390
That's my man.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.240
What did you just say?

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.850
Phone.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.740
- It's fine.
- Answer it.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.440
Hey, big brother! When are you coming back?

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.090
You're too loud.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.290
But...

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.190
everyone's saying you're going to abandon the ocean

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.040
abandon this island.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.590
Hey, wait...

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.820
you could at least deny it.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.720
I know.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.220
Just a little longer.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.230
Just give me a little more time.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.570
What's troubling you?

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.490
Hello.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.630
Kaishin.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.290
How do you know my name?

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.550
I want to buy you.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:16.630
Huh?

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.480
You were bought by Ai with money anyway, right?

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.720
I'll be your client, too.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.320
You...

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.430
How much to buy you?

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:16.820
Fumi!

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.430
Ah.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.320
Hello, Grandma?

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.570
I'm fine.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.600
Um...

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.640
It's just...

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.650
the person I like hates me.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.050
Huh?

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.360
You want me to say you passed away?

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.960
I can't do that.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.420
No, no, no.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:38.800
No, no, no, no, no
