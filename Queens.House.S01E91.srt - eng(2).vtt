00:00:00.914 --> 00:00:02.284
(Episode 91)

00:00:02.672 --> 00:00:05.142
The six million dollars you blew on that land deal.

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.212
This is it! You con artist!

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.682
This money...

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.452
It's that same money?

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:19.322
Oh Seong, you tell me.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.052
Is it really my money?

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:22.792
Was it all a con?

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:24.592
That's right. This is your six million dollars.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:28.592
You pulled this whole stunt with my six million dollars?

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:32.502
Darn it! What a bunch of scumbags!

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:35.372
Are you saying that you were conned...

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:38.142
and these people are the ones who did it?

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.512
Gi Chan, call the police.

00:00:40.812 --> 00:00:43.812
They're a family of con artists! They set me up from the start.

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:47.912
How dare you donate my money?

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:50.622
A donation? Who gave you the right!

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:52.682
How is this your money?

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.952
The seed money for your fortune in the first place.

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.222
Where did that money come from?

00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:02.562
Well... That was from...

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:05.932
Some of it was what my husband left behind.

00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:10.302
You said your husband went bankrupt, drank to death, and left you broke!

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:12.042
You begged me for a single room...

00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:14.012
where you and your kids can live.

00:01:15.972 --> 00:01:17.012
Listen up, all of you.

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:19.412
Everything you've eaten and drunk,

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:21.682
the whole life of luxury you've been living...

00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:24.152
was paid...

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:27.352
for with my husband's life!

00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:35.392
Ms. Hwang Na Ra.

00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:39.432
Because of a fire you accidentally started as a child,

00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:43.032
your house burned down, and you were traumatized, right?

00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:45.872
And that your mother, Ms. Noh, told you...

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.342
that no one died in that accident. Is that correct?

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:51.782
My mom was clear.

00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:55.312
She was positive that no one died.

00:01:57.522 --> 00:01:58.522
Right, Mom?

00:01:58.852 --> 00:01:59.852
No.

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:01.392
In that fire,

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:04.122
my father died.

00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:08.232
Your mother, Noh Sook Ja,

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.162
took the fire insurance payout in my father's name,

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.072
and the life insurance, then ran off in the middle of the night.

00:02:15.272 --> 00:02:18.072
If she had just called for help when the fire started,

00:02:18.342 --> 00:02:19.872
my brother-in-law would have lived.

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:22.212
And if she had just left the insurance money alone,

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.112
my sister wouldn't have had to struggle to raise her kids.

00:02:25.982 --> 00:02:28.612
Just thinking of the way you and your family lived...

00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:31.582
makes me want to set a fire myself too.

00:02:33.422 --> 00:02:35.622
But you should be darn grateful I'm holding myself back.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.622
If you want to call the police, go ahead.

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.232
But there's no proof that Ms. Noh was scammed.

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.862
There are only records of her depositing the money herself.

00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:49.202
And it was the account for my father's foundation.

00:02:49.832 --> 00:02:51.172
Even if you do report it,

00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:54.972
I doubt they'd believe it was a scam when you donated the money yourself.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.012
You little...

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:03.482
And I've already told the press. By tomorrow morning,

00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:08.352
people will know what kind of family Chairman Hwang Gi Chan comes from.

00:03:09.492 --> 00:03:10.492
That's enough. Let's go.

00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:12.792
I've seen enough of these disgusting faces.

00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:14.462
My eyes will rot.

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:22.972
Because of me,

00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:26.672
someone died?

00:03:29.112 --> 00:03:30.912
Na Ra, are you okay?

00:03:31.682 --> 00:03:32.682
My money.

00:03:32.942 --> 00:03:35.082
My money!

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:36.752
My money!

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:52.502
My money.

00:03:53.302 --> 00:03:54.302
My money.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:56.402
Mom, please say something.

00:03:57.302 --> 00:03:59.142
Is what they said before all true?

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:02.512
Mom!

00:04:03.112 --> 00:04:04.112
Gi Chan.

00:04:05.242 --> 00:04:06.282
What am I going to do about my money?

00:04:07.052 --> 00:04:08.382
What a waste. What will I do?

00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:09.952
You're worried about money right now?

00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:12.082
Is it true or not?

00:04:13.182 --> 00:04:14.192
What about the fire?

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:16.352
Did you really steal the insurance money too?

00:04:18.722 --> 00:04:19.922
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:21.892
The insurance money? How could you?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.262
This is so humiliating.

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:28.902
Why does my family always have to be the one dragging me down?

00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:31.972
Do you think I did that just for myself?

00:04:32.602 --> 00:04:35.612
It was all for the three of you.

00:04:36.072 --> 00:04:38.812
But still, how could you commit a crime?

00:04:40.582 --> 00:04:44.682
Do you know how hard a widow has it to raise three kids on her own?

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.022
I never had much of an education.

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:49.052
And I had no skills.

00:04:49.652 --> 00:04:51.122
Living in a rented room in the shanty town.

00:04:51.962 --> 00:04:54.562
It was nothing more than a roof over our heads.

00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:56.962
We were basically beggars.

00:04:57.732 --> 00:04:59.602
You kids had no idea we were out of rice.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.732
You were always whining about being hungry.

00:05:02.332 --> 00:05:05.702
You'd whine about being cold, not knowing we were out of coal.

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.612
After I barely managed to feed the three of you,

00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:12.942
I'd fill my own stomach with tap water.

00:05:13.582 --> 00:05:14.682
But still...

00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:19.122
Na Ra was so hungry that she snuck into a place to steal some food,

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:21.092
and she knocked over the portable stove.

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:23.552
A fire started in an instant,

00:05:24.422 --> 00:05:26.092
and I was terrified I was going to die too.

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:29.162
I barely made it out with Na Ra.

00:05:30.402 --> 00:05:32.602
Was it wrong for me to fight to survive?

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.132
Should we have just died in there?

00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:41.512
Fine. I stole the insurance money.

00:05:42.142 --> 00:05:44.542
When I saw a chance to get money, I couldn't see straight.

00:05:45.642 --> 00:05:48.012
If it wasn't for that money, all three of you would be dead.

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:50.582
Without it, I couldn't have sent you to school.

00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:53.022
Law school, becoming a prosecutor...

00:05:53.522 --> 00:05:55.022
you couldn't have even dreamed of it.

00:05:55.752 --> 00:05:57.992
I'm so sick and tired of being poor.

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:00.222
That's why I fought tooth and nail to survive.

00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:04.162
I did bad things and broke the law.

00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:05.662
Just to survive.

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:09.432
Was it wrong for me to live like that for you?

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:16.272
My money!

00:06:18.442 --> 00:06:20.312
My money!

00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:24.182
My hard-earned money!

00:06:35.432 --> 00:06:37.162
Na Ra, what's wrong?

00:06:37.702 --> 00:06:38.702
Are you crying?

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:49.142
Are you okay?

00:07:00.922 --> 00:07:03.492
I thought you went to sleep early after preschool,

00:07:04.262 --> 00:07:05.422
but I guess the noise woke you up.

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:09.162
Yes, I want to go play with Gi Man now.

00:07:10.092 --> 00:07:12.402
Ji Ho, you want to play with me?

00:07:18.302 --> 00:07:19.302
Ji Ho.

00:07:19.742 --> 00:07:22.942
Besides this toy, is there anything else you want?

00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:24.582
A toy?

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:28.982
Ji Ho?

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:30.982
Dad.

00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:35.892
What are you doing in Ji Ho's room?

00:07:36.752 --> 00:07:39.522
He seemed bored by himself, so I was keeping him company.

00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:44.732
What's he doing in here?

00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:47.062
He was looking after Ji Ho for me.

00:07:47.932 --> 00:07:49.102
And where's the rest of the family?

00:07:49.932 --> 00:07:50.942
Something came up.

00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:53.542
Ji Ho, did you have fun playing with him?

00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:55.472
Yes, it was fun.

00:07:56.472 --> 00:07:58.682
Ji Ho. Let's play again sometime.

00:08:00.552 --> 00:08:01.552
I should get going.

00:08:10.152 --> 00:08:12.062
Just hearing about it is so satisfying.

00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:15.662
You know that saying, "What goes around, comes around?"

00:08:16.232 --> 00:08:19.232
Eventually, you get what's coming to you.

00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:23.102
Yun Hee, I feel like a weight I've carried for 50 years is gone.

00:08:23.272 --> 00:08:26.202
I won't have to feign a smile in front of Noh Sook Ja anymore.

00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:28.972
My face would cramp up from faking it.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:33.142
I know you've been through a lot.

00:08:33.582 --> 00:08:35.512
Your brother-in-law will thank you.

00:08:35.752 --> 00:08:36.812
You think so?

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:40.422
Brother-in-law, don't mention it. I just did what had to be done.

00:08:40.482 --> 00:08:43.622
Just buy me a drink next time you see me.

00:08:47.232 --> 00:08:48.632
It's good to see you smile.

00:08:49.092 --> 00:08:51.502
Mother, today is a good day.

00:08:51.802 --> 00:08:53.162
You finally brought justice for Father.

00:08:53.362 --> 00:08:56.872
You're right. The grudge is done. What a good day.

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:01.512
Right, did you tell them you met Tae Oh?

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.542
I think he's staying at Hwang Gi Chan's place.

00:09:08.752 --> 00:09:10.412
Of all places, why that house?

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:14.752
I heard he dated Kang Se Ri, right?

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:16.722
You think there's still something between them?

00:09:17.052 --> 00:09:18.162
I don't think so.

00:09:18.722 --> 00:09:19.722
No.

00:09:24.902 --> 00:09:26.302
You should head in.

00:09:27.502 --> 00:09:28.902
It's close by. I'll give you a ride.

00:09:29.332 --> 00:09:30.472
I think that'd be best.

00:09:32.202 --> 00:09:34.912
Ms. Jung may not show it,

00:09:34.912 --> 00:09:36.342
but she must be going through a lot.

00:09:37.342 --> 00:09:39.242
Losing Do Hee must have been devastating enough,

00:09:39.742 --> 00:09:41.782
but her husband dying like that...

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:43.212
I can't imagine how difficult it is.

00:09:44.822 --> 00:09:45.922
Please be there for her.

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:51.792
Thanks for looking after Bo Ram so well today.

00:09:53.222 --> 00:09:55.462
If anything, I should be the one thanking Bo Ram.

00:09:56.592 --> 00:09:58.432
Being with Bo Ram is so therapeutic.

00:09:58.902 --> 00:09:59.902
She puts me at ease.

00:10:02.732 --> 00:10:04.802
About Lee Tae Oh...

00:10:05.842 --> 00:10:07.772
Do you know why he's staying at Hwang Gi Chan's place?

00:10:08.972 --> 00:10:09.972
No.

00:10:10.372 --> 00:10:13.242
I have a hunch, but I'm not entirely sure.

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:15.582
What is it?

00:10:17.782 --> 00:10:19.122
I'm not positive.

00:10:19.382 --> 00:10:20.822
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

00:10:21.752 --> 00:10:23.052
You should get going.

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:25.122
Okay.

00:10:27.932 --> 00:10:29.192
Jae In.

00:10:33.162 --> 00:10:36.772
I think Tae Oh said something about you being his "destiny."

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:39.372
Is there a story behind that?

00:10:43.712 --> 00:10:45.942
It's nothing. There's no story behind it.

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.152
Why the sudden question?

00:10:50.012 --> 00:10:51.022
No reason.

00:10:52.182 --> 00:10:54.322
I was just curious.

00:10:57.762 --> 00:10:58.792
I'm so furious.

00:11:00.062 --> 00:11:01.262
It's so unfair!

00:11:02.132 --> 00:11:04.162
I was so upset that I couldn't sleep a wink.

00:11:05.502 --> 00:11:06.902
It's all false information.

00:11:07.732 --> 00:11:09.232
Tell them it's all completely baseless.

00:11:10.332 --> 00:11:12.072
The arson, the insurance fraud...

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.302
All of it!

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:15.212
I'm telling you to kill every one of those articles.

00:11:16.912 --> 00:11:19.412
Did those jerks really get the press to publish all that?

00:11:21.052 --> 00:11:23.982
The statute of limitations, whatever,

00:11:23.982 --> 00:11:25.422
has already expired for all that,

00:11:25.722 --> 00:11:27.622
and it's not that big of a deal.

00:11:27.952 --> 00:11:30.052
Besides, I was a victim of the fraud too.

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:32.162
If anyone should be punished, it's them.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.192
This isn't about whether or not we get punished.

00:11:35.792 --> 00:11:37.092
This is Kim Do Yun's family we're dealing with!

00:11:38.162 --> 00:11:40.402
We've just handed DH Holdings the perfect excuse to come after us.

00:11:41.402 --> 00:11:43.832
We look like fools to Lee Tae Oh. What is this mess?

00:11:45.102 --> 00:11:46.272
Mr. Lee...

00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:49.842
wouldn't back out of selling the paintings over this, would he?

00:11:50.782 --> 00:11:53.612
He didn't say anything when he left for work, though.

00:11:55.012 --> 00:11:56.112
If he does ask you anything,

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.282
just tell him it never happened,

00:11:58.552 --> 00:11:59.852
that you're the victim who was framed.

00:12:01.952 --> 00:12:02.952
Okay.

00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:05.462
Ugly lady.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.492
Why are you still crying today?

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:14.672
Don't cry. You'll look even uglier.

00:12:16.272 --> 00:12:17.272
Gi Man.

00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:20.002
It's all my fault.

00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:24.782
Because I started the fire,

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:26.982
someone died.

00:12:28.312 --> 00:12:30.252
But I'm not dead.

00:12:31.652 --> 00:12:33.352
I really had no idea.

00:12:34.552 --> 00:12:37.292
I really didn't know someone had died.

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:41.732
I didn't even know my mom took the insurance money.

00:12:42.932 --> 00:12:44.832
What am I supposed to do, Gi Man?

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:48.102
I'm so scared.

00:12:49.172 --> 00:12:51.342
What am I going to do?

00:13:03.212 --> 00:13:05.982
Mom, these are all presents for you!

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:10.922
So, what I have here...

00:13:11.522 --> 00:13:14.592
are almonds and walnuts,

00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:18.102
so you have to eat them every day. Don't forget, okay?

00:13:18.702 --> 00:13:19.732
That's what will make you healthy.

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:24.272
Here.

00:13:33.912 --> 00:13:35.752
How is it? Good, right?

00:13:36.752 --> 00:13:37.752
Yes.

00:13:38.682 --> 00:13:39.682
It's delicious.

00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:46.462
And this is a jigsaw puzzle.

00:13:47.222 --> 00:13:48.662
You like art, don't you, Mom?

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:51.502
It turns into an amazing picture when you finish it.

00:13:52.162 --> 00:13:53.232
Do you want to do it together?

00:13:54.432 --> 00:13:55.702
I don't want to.

00:13:55.732 --> 00:13:56.772
Maybe later.

00:13:56.932 --> 00:13:58.772
Why not? Let's play it together.

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:00.772
Go to work.

00:14:01.142 --> 00:14:02.412
What are you going to do if you're late?

00:14:04.682 --> 00:14:08.212
If Dad scolds me, so be it. I have you, Mom.

00:14:12.182 --> 00:14:13.222
Mom.

00:14:14.322 --> 00:14:17.762
I love you more than anyone in the world, Mom.

00:14:18.262 --> 00:14:21.792
I'm not kidding. I really, really love you.

00:14:25.902 --> 00:14:27.432
So, Mom,

00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:29.332
you can't get sick, okay?

00:14:31.402 --> 00:14:32.642
You have to stay healthy.

00:14:35.412 --> 00:14:36.712
And you can't forget me.

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:40.812
I would be so heartbroken if you did.

00:14:42.952 --> 00:14:43.982
Seung Woo...

00:14:46.022 --> 00:14:47.792
Mom, promise me one thing.

00:14:49.292 --> 00:14:50.852
Since I'm your son,

00:14:51.792 --> 00:14:53.762
and I'm going to protect you until the very end,

00:14:54.462 --> 00:14:56.162
please stay by my side for a long, long time.

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:00.532
Come on.

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:06.502
Like this.

00:15:07.472 --> 00:15:08.542
We made a promise.

00:15:27.022 --> 00:15:28.292
Seung Woo is gone.

00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:30.362
Yes.

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:35.602
Do you remember that Seung Woo was just here?

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:40.642
Does Seung Woo know about my condition?

00:15:41.812 --> 00:15:42.812
Yes.

00:15:51.222 --> 00:15:53.022
So, I guess everyone knows now.

00:15:54.852 --> 00:15:56.592
I suppose I can't hide it anymore.

00:15:57.352 --> 00:15:58.462
Lately, Seung Woo...

00:15:59.362 --> 00:16:02.362
comes to see you every day before work.

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:04.862
He brings snacks,

00:16:05.002 --> 00:16:06.702
flowers, and books.

00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:11.302
I always thought he was just an immature kid,

00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:12.942
but he's turned out so well.

00:16:14.172 --> 00:16:16.072
You did a wonderful job raising him.

00:16:24.082 --> 00:16:25.752
It's not just the PR Team.

00:16:26.322 --> 00:16:28.592
The company's phone lines are blowing up.

00:16:30.692 --> 00:16:31.922
They're just rumours.

00:16:32.962 --> 00:16:34.862
We'll find a way to make them die down.

00:16:35.192 --> 00:16:38.602
Are you trying to gaslight me into thinking this is fake news?

00:16:40.102 --> 00:16:41.372
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

00:16:41.672 --> 00:16:46.102
that won't work. I know too much about you and your family.

00:16:46.842 --> 00:16:49.572
Do you really think you can pull the wool over my eyes?

00:16:51.112 --> 00:16:53.382
There's a limit to the family issues of an owner we can tolerate.

00:16:53.982 --> 00:16:56.282
Stop tarnishing YL Group's reputation,

00:16:56.652 --> 00:16:58.852
and at this point, shouldn't you have the decency to step down?

00:16:59.322 --> 00:17:01.722
Don't just pay lip service to doing what's best for YL Group.

00:17:01.992 --> 00:17:03.392
Stepping down is the right thing to do.

00:17:04.252 --> 00:17:05.422
Have you no sense of responsibility?

00:17:07.692 --> 00:17:09.092
I will find a way to contain this.

00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:12.602
Suit yourself.

00:17:13.202 --> 00:17:16.132
I can already see how this is going to end anyway.

00:17:16.572 --> 00:17:18.172
Go ahead and put up one last desperate fight.

00:17:20.402 --> 00:17:23.272
There's no point in talking to you. I'm leaving.

00:17:24.682 --> 00:17:25.982
I'm sorry, Aunt.

00:17:27.682 --> 00:17:28.982
This is a place of business.

00:17:29.312 --> 00:17:30.982
Address me by my proper title.

00:17:31.452 --> 00:17:32.982
That word, "Aunt,"

00:17:33.322 --> 00:17:34.592
refrain from using it in my presence.

00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:38.622
Oh, right.

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:40.022
I've received...

00:17:40.462 --> 00:17:42.962
Designer L's final design proposal.

00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:45.802
Apparently, she wants to terminate her project contract...

00:17:45.832 --> 00:17:47.162
with YL Group.

00:17:47.972 --> 00:17:49.002
Extend it.

00:17:50.232 --> 00:17:52.102
Arrange for her to take on a new project.

00:17:54.242 --> 00:17:56.672
As long as Chairman Hwang Gi Chan is at YL Group,

00:17:57.012 --> 00:18:00.282
she made it very clear that she will not sign another contract.

00:18:12.922 --> 00:18:15.992
Jae In knows, by the way, that you're staying at that house.

00:18:16.732 --> 00:18:18.462
I didn't see any reason to hide it.

00:18:19.002 --> 00:18:20.162
Is that a problem?

00:18:20.362 --> 00:18:23.472
It's not so much a problem as something to be careful about.

00:18:24.672 --> 00:18:27.872
You know that we're investigating Kang Se Ri, correct?

00:18:28.972 --> 00:18:31.842
Look, I can take a hint. I have no intention of being a spy.

00:18:32.382 --> 00:18:36.152
I haven't said a single word to Kang Se Ri about this.

00:18:37.752 --> 00:18:40.982
You may not trust me, but you trust Jae In, don't you?

00:18:41.722 --> 00:18:43.322
I trust Kang Jae In too.

00:18:45.022 --> 00:18:46.062
You have a point.

00:18:46.722 --> 00:18:48.292
I trust Kang Jae In too.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.362
I trust Jae In too.

00:18:52.002 --> 00:18:53.002
Okay.

00:18:53.002 --> 00:18:55.232
Now that you know our position, please be careful.

00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:57.232
Will do.

00:18:57.502 --> 00:19:00.272
- Well, I have a meeting to get to. - Right, go ahead.

00:19:07.612 --> 00:19:08.612
Jae In.

00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:10.712
Where are you off to?

00:19:11.182 --> 00:19:13.322
To a meeting. Where are you off to?

00:19:13.422 --> 00:19:14.492
To the office.

00:19:14.792 --> 00:19:16.722
I just submitted the final design proposal,

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:19.962
and my contract with YL Group ends this week.

00:19:20.362 --> 00:19:22.892
Does that mean you'll be working out of our office now?

00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:24.462
That's the plan.

00:19:24.462 --> 00:19:25.632
Starting next week.

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:30.602
Why?

00:19:31.372 --> 00:19:34.812
I'm just happy I'll get to see you every day.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.142
Was it that obvious?

00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:57.862
You're going to be late for your meeting. Go on.

00:19:58.162 --> 00:19:59.532
All right, I'm going.

00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:00.832
Okay.

00:20:16.912 --> 00:20:17.952
What are you doing?

00:20:19.152 --> 00:20:20.182
Let go of me.

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:24.052
Let go!

00:20:25.562 --> 00:20:26.622
What do you think you're doing?

00:20:26.962 --> 00:20:27.962
And what about you?

00:20:28.392 --> 00:20:29.462
This is the office.

00:20:29.862 --> 00:20:31.192
It's not a place for you to be dating.

00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:34.032
Don't you have more to worry about than me?

00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:37.432
Your mother is really something else.

00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:40.042
She just watched someone die without trying to save them,

00:20:40.402 --> 00:20:42.472
and then she had the nerve to steal the life insurance money?

00:20:43.572 --> 00:20:44.742
Is that what Kim Do Yun told you?

00:20:45.242 --> 00:20:46.642
Don't believe a word that guy says.

00:20:46.942 --> 00:20:48.352
That was over 20 years ago.

00:20:48.782 --> 00:20:50.852
How do you know he isn't just making baseless accusations?

00:20:52.422 --> 00:20:55.922
Noh Sook Ja and Hwang Na Ra. They're witnesses. Is that baseless?

00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:58.022
You're the one making baseless claims.

00:20:58.922 --> 00:21:01.222
So you're just going to believe...

00:21:01.222 --> 00:21:02.332
everything Kim Do Yun says?

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.762
What is he to you?

00:21:05.502 --> 00:21:06.802
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:11.302
I told you that I love you.

00:21:11.802 --> 00:21:13.442
And I made myself clear.

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:15.442
Don't you dare say that to me.

00:21:16.172 --> 00:21:18.012
You don't have the right to say those words.

00:21:19.342 --> 00:21:21.582
Doesn't that mean he doesn't have the right either?

00:21:23.252 --> 00:21:24.822
Setting aside the fire incident,

00:21:25.022 --> 00:21:26.052
his own sibling died,

00:21:26.052 --> 00:21:27.852
and yet he's obsessed with you. Is that normal?

00:21:28.052 --> 00:21:29.192
The guy's insane.

00:21:29.652 --> 00:21:33.622
Think about why he approached you. To investigate Kim Do Hee's death,

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:35.192
or to get his revenge.

00:21:35.632 --> 00:21:37.262
That's not exactly pure love, is it?

00:21:38.262 --> 00:21:39.302
Am I wrong?

00:21:42.502 --> 00:21:43.832
I loved you.

00:21:46.402 --> 00:21:48.072
If it hadn't been for your mother...

00:21:49.412 --> 00:21:51.012
If I hadn't been so disrespected,

00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:54.442
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:21:55.712 --> 00:21:57.412
So you're saying this is all my mom's fault?

00:21:58.022 --> 00:22:00.582
You're wrong. Don't try to shift the blame.

00:22:01.252 --> 00:22:03.122
My mom tried to accept you.

00:22:03.552 --> 00:22:04.962
She did before we got married,

00:22:05.362 --> 00:22:07.592
and she made it clear to me even after.

00:22:09.262 --> 00:22:10.292
If I were to have regrets...

00:22:15.302 --> 00:22:16.302
I do have regrets.

00:22:18.442 --> 00:22:19.572
I do regret it.

00:22:21.002 --> 00:22:22.042
I, too,

00:22:24.012 --> 00:22:25.682
deserve to love you.

00:22:30.152 --> 00:22:31.212
You psycho.

00:22:33.052 --> 00:22:34.652
Leaving all that aside, do you know why...

00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:36.622
Do Yun is qualified, and you're not?

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:40.022
At least, Do Yun isn't a married man.

00:22:41.462 --> 00:22:42.892
Because I'm not Kang Se Ri.

00:22:43.532 --> 00:22:45.962
I don't have a twisted hobby of stealing what isn't mine.

00:23:15.392 --> 00:23:16.732
Why did you call for me?

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:18.662
It's exciting when you call for me.

00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:20.862
You must be having a hard time because of your mother.

00:23:21.832 --> 00:23:24.272
I heard Na Ra and Gi Man talking this morning.

00:23:24.842 --> 00:23:26.302
The statute of limitations has expired.

00:23:26.372 --> 00:23:27.802
She should've just denied it.

00:23:28.272 --> 00:23:30.442
Your mother is so naive sometimes.

00:23:30.812 --> 00:23:32.642
It just made things more difficult for you for no reason.

00:23:33.112 --> 00:23:35.982
Honey, people will forget all about this in time.

00:23:36.282 --> 00:23:37.382
Don't worry too much.

00:23:39.582 --> 00:23:40.582
Let's get a divorce.

00:23:42.952 --> 00:23:43.952
I said, let's get a divorce.

00:23:44.622 --> 00:23:45.622
Honey.

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:48.592
Leave Ji Ho here. I'll raise him.

00:23:48.732 --> 00:23:49.932
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.762
Why do you take your anger over your mother out on me?

00:23:51.762 --> 00:23:53.402
I did nothing wrong.

00:23:53.802 --> 00:23:55.332
You know full well this isn't sudden.

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:57.672
We just happen to live in the same house.

00:23:58.502 --> 00:24:00.102
We haven't been a real couple for a long time.

00:24:02.472 --> 00:24:04.012
Let's just finalize this with an uncontested divorce.

00:24:04.542 --> 00:24:05.542
I can't divorce you.

00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:08.652
How could you possibly raise Ji Ho by yourself?

00:24:08.852 --> 00:24:10.482
I'm going to try to start over with Jae In.

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:12.052
Is that what Kang Jae In told you?

00:24:12.282 --> 00:24:13.952
Did she tell you to divorce me and get back together with her?

00:24:14.652 --> 00:24:16.322
Snap out of it, Hwang Gi Chan!

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:20.192
Do you think you two can get back together just because you want to?

00:24:21.222 --> 00:24:24.362
Kang Jae In can't stand the sight of you.

00:24:25.002 --> 00:24:26.062
You know that better than anyone.

00:24:26.532 --> 00:24:28.772
- Be realistic. - I don't care.

00:24:29.402 --> 00:24:30.972
I'll make her come back to me one way or another.

00:24:32.772 --> 00:24:34.202
All I have to do is make it happen.

00:24:34.342 --> 00:24:35.672
I can't get a divorce.

00:24:35.672 --> 00:24:37.412
No, I won't.

00:24:37.912 --> 00:24:39.042
So you two can be happy?

00:24:40.142 --> 00:24:41.752
It'll be better for you to end this on good terms.

00:24:45.952 --> 00:24:47.122
I've said my piece.

00:24:47.722 --> 00:24:48.722
You can go now.

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:53.762
See Kang Jae In all you want.

00:24:54.592 --> 00:24:56.932
Then, she gets to be the other woman this time.

00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.762
I am never divorcing you.

00:25:15.012 --> 00:25:16.582
You're still up?

00:25:17.352 --> 00:25:18.422
I couldn't get to sleep.

00:25:18.952 --> 00:25:20.822
I saw the light on and thought I'd come in.

00:25:21.652 --> 00:25:22.922
Well then, care for a drink?

00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:32.462
I'm sorry for all the chaos in the house these past two days.

00:25:33.132 --> 00:25:35.132
Everything you've seen and heard is not true.

00:25:35.702 --> 00:25:36.802
There's no evidence,

00:25:37.172 --> 00:25:38.842
and if anything, we're the ones who were defrauded.

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:42.342
You don't need to explain yourself to me.

00:25:42.872 --> 00:25:45.382
I don't really pay attention to gossip.

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:47.712
That's very wise of you.

00:25:51.622 --> 00:25:53.552
I heard you decided to collaborate with Designer L?

00:25:54.382 --> 00:25:57.752
Yes. It looks like I'll be staying in Korea longer because of it.

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:06.102
I was just having a drink with Chairman Hwang.

00:26:06.602 --> 00:26:07.602
Why don't you join us?

00:26:17.972 --> 00:26:20.412
Honey, your stomach is upset. Don't drink too much.

00:26:21.412 --> 00:26:22.912
I can take care of myself. I'm fine.

00:26:25.222 --> 00:26:28.752
I heard that CEO Jung Oh Seong of DH Holdings found his son,

00:26:29.122 --> 00:26:30.122
did you know?

00:26:30.852 --> 00:26:32.292
Yes, I know.

00:26:32.922 --> 00:26:35.162
He didn't even know his son existed,

00:26:35.892 --> 00:26:37.162
but he's found out recently.

00:26:38.462 --> 00:26:41.362
I heard he was overjoyed, knowing he had a son was enough.

00:26:42.332 --> 00:26:43.372
Well, he's his son.

00:26:44.172 --> 00:26:45.372
It's hard to explain,

00:26:45.742 --> 00:26:47.142
but there's something about a blood connection.

00:26:47.702 --> 00:26:49.542
It's like a magnetic pull.

00:26:51.372 --> 00:26:52.612
A magnetic pull?

00:26:53.312 --> 00:26:54.642
Exactly. I think that's it.

00:26:56.052 --> 00:26:59.552
Actually, I only just found out you have a son.

00:27:00.522 --> 00:27:01.582
A son?

00:27:02.352 --> 00:27:03.452
You mean your son?

00:27:04.092 --> 00:27:05.092
Yes.

00:27:05.992 --> 00:27:08.192
It's a case similar to CEO Jung's.

00:27:09.062 --> 00:27:11.702
I truly had no idea, but a son...

00:27:15.872 --> 00:27:16.872
is out there.

00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:25.512
So it was my first love, and she got married.

00:27:26.582 --> 00:27:29.112
The man she married believes the boy is his own son.

00:27:31.552 --> 00:27:33.452
If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

00:27:34.682 --> 00:27:36.652
Should I tell them I'm the real father?

00:27:37.552 --> 00:27:38.692
Well...

00:27:39.222 --> 00:27:40.622
If you didn't know, that would be one thing,

00:27:41.762 --> 00:27:42.962
but now you do, shouldn't you tell them?

00:27:45.662 --> 00:27:46.762
What do you think I should do?

00:27:47.762 --> 00:27:48.932
Should I tell them?

00:27:50.172 --> 00:27:51.842
You have to think this through carefully.

00:27:52.802 --> 00:27:55.842
Your selfish ways could ruin a family.

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.942
Your son could end up miserable.

00:27:59.212 --> 00:28:02.112
A love built on a lie like that is wrong from the start.

00:28:03.312 --> 00:28:04.752
If she'd been honest at first, it'd be different.

00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:06.952
A family built on a lie like that won't last.

00:28:08.422 --> 00:28:09.922
The truth is bound to come out eventually,

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.362
so it's best to tell him soon.

00:28:14.022 --> 00:28:15.092
I see.

00:28:16.262 --> 00:28:18.762
This is helping me clear my head.

00:28:29.312 --> 00:28:30.742
I'm heading out. Keep an eye on the house.

00:28:31.372 --> 00:28:33.182
Okay. Will you be back late?

00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:34.842
I don't know.

00:28:35.482 --> 00:28:38.312
My mind is in turmoil. I need to go pray with all my heart.

00:28:38.552 --> 00:28:41.552
- What about Na Ra? - She's in her room, not coming out.

00:28:43.552 --> 00:28:45.162
Gi Man, what are you doing?

00:28:48.292 --> 00:28:50.832
Mom, can't I stay home?

00:28:50.992 --> 00:28:53.502
Doing the 108 bows is too hard.

00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:56.672
My legs hurt, my head hurts, and my knees hurt too.

00:28:57.072 --> 00:29:00.242
You have to pray with devotion so that the deities will be moved...

00:29:00.442 --> 00:29:02.842
and maybe fix that messed-up head of yours.

00:29:03.612 --> 00:29:06.942
You should've been more careful. Why did you have to miss a step?

00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:09.612
Mom, I wasn't going down the stairs.

00:29:10.052 --> 00:29:12.682
- I was pushed. - Not this again.

00:29:13.252 --> 00:29:14.322
But it's true.

00:29:15.452 --> 00:29:16.452
Right?

00:29:16.992 --> 00:29:17.992
Isn't that right?

00:29:18.522 --> 00:29:20.292
How would I know?

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:22.162
You're the one who pushed me.

00:29:28.432 --> 00:29:30.572
She really pushed you?

00:29:31.902 --> 00:29:34.842
Yes, in my dream, a witch pushed me.

00:29:35.612 --> 00:29:37.712
For goodness' sake.

00:29:38.072 --> 00:29:39.082
Come on.

00:29:40.412 --> 00:29:41.642
Mom, you're like a leopard.

00:29:42.782 --> 00:29:44.582
Since I was treated to such a great home-cooked meal,

00:29:44.952 --> 00:29:46.322
today is definitely on me.

00:29:46.922 --> 00:29:50.452
What would you like? I heard something here is amazing.

00:29:55.692 --> 00:29:56.692
Kang Seung Woo.

00:29:57.762 --> 00:29:58.762
Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

00:30:00.032 --> 00:30:01.062
Listen.

00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:05.032
What I'm trying to say is...

00:30:10.342 --> 00:30:11.342
I'm...

00:30:15.682 --> 00:30:16.682
I'm your father.

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:24.992
This again? You're practising for acting, right?

00:30:25.322 --> 00:30:27.762
That performance felt so real.

00:30:28.162 --> 00:30:29.392
Is the date for the play set?

00:30:29.762 --> 00:30:30.932
When can I come see it?

00:30:31.762 --> 00:30:34.532
Well, it's definitely the real deal.

00:30:35.802 --> 00:30:36.872
Sorry.

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:38.542
I'm late, aren't I?

00:30:41.742 --> 00:30:43.572
I didn't know you were coming too.

00:30:45.882 --> 00:30:47.512
What's going on here?

00:30:49.412 --> 00:30:50.512
Something smells fishy.

00:30:51.782 --> 00:30:53.422
Are you two dating?

00:30:58.292 --> 00:31:00.422
We are dating.

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:02.092
No way!

00:31:02.632 --> 00:31:05.302
Then shouldn't you two be buying me dinner?

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:09.572
You haven't told him yet, have you?

00:31:14.142 --> 00:31:15.172
Do you want me to?

00:31:15.642 --> 00:31:16.672
No.

00:31:20.842 --> 00:31:21.842
Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

00:31:22.852 --> 00:31:24.552
I'm not rehearsing for a play,

00:31:24.912 --> 00:31:26.522
and I'm not messing with you.

00:31:27.722 --> 00:31:28.792
I am...

00:31:31.852 --> 00:31:34.592
I'm really your father.

00:31:45.742 --> 00:31:46.972
Let me introduce myself properly.

00:31:47.842 --> 00:31:48.842
It's nice to finally meet you.

00:31:50.512 --> 00:31:51.512
Son.

00:31:55.812 --> 00:31:56.812
Is this for real?

00:32:02.022 --> 00:32:03.722
I know this is a huge shock.

00:32:05.392 --> 00:32:06.422
I was too.

00:32:07.562 --> 00:32:08.962
That I had a son,

00:32:09.532 --> 00:32:11.032
and that he was you.

00:32:12.132 --> 00:32:13.602
I've only recently found out myself.

00:32:18.372 --> 00:32:22.042
Honestly, I never saw this coming.

00:32:23.342 --> 00:32:26.082
I mean, I thought you two might have a history, but...

00:32:29.212 --> 00:32:30.312
I'm sorry.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.782
I just don't know what to say right now.

00:32:35.992 --> 00:32:37.022
There's no rush.

00:32:37.592 --> 00:32:38.922
I don't want to pressure you, either.

00:32:39.822 --> 00:32:42.392
Just say what's on your mind when you're ready.

00:33:06.882 --> 00:33:08.322
You're so smart.

00:33:09.752 --> 00:33:12.492
Then, where should I put mine?

00:33:38.722 --> 00:33:40.022
I can't just leave him like this.

00:33:57.832 --> 00:34:01.372
Ji Ho, go have a snack and play. That coffee is for Tae Oh, okay?

00:34:01.772 --> 00:34:02.772
Okay.

00:34:06.982 --> 00:34:10.552
Mom, he fell asleep reading to me.

00:34:11.982 --> 00:34:13.952
He must've been very tired.

00:34:14.522 --> 00:34:16.822
Ji Ho, why don't you go watch cartoons...

00:34:16.922 --> 00:34:18.722
so he can get some rest?

00:34:20.062 --> 00:34:23.132
When he wakes up, tell him I'm watching cartoons.

00:34:23.592 --> 00:34:24.592
Okay.

00:35:38.772 --> 00:35:42.672
(Queen's House)

00:35:43.012 --> 00:35:44.472
I really didn't know.

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:47.742
I didn't know anyone was being hurt because of what I did.

00:35:48.082 --> 00:35:49.682
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:35:50.082 --> 00:35:51.252
It belongs to Hwang Na Ra.

00:35:52.482 --> 00:35:55.082
I guess there's at least one sane person in that family.

00:35:55.822 --> 00:35:57.722
How could it all have been a lie?

00:35:58.092 --> 00:36:00.722
You jerk. You absolute monster!

00:36:01.892 --> 00:36:03.832
Say something! I said, say something!

00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:07.732
- Did you ever even love me? - And I'm not at all sorry to say,

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:11.102
but there was never a single moment I had feelings for you.

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:12.942
Tae Oh isn't here either.

00:36:13.602 --> 00:36:14.602
Where did he go?

00:36:16.272 --> 00:36:18.272
If you're so curious, why don't you call and ask him yourself?
