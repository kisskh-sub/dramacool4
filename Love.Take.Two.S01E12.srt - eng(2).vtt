00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.020
Why is it taking much longer than expected?

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.340
It's been more than two hours.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.930
It'll be okay.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.500
Doctor.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.270
You must've been worried.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.920
The location wasn't as bad as expected.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.700
It took extra time to remove it
as much as possible.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.050
The surgery went well.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.330
She endured it well.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.000
Good work, Dr. Lee.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.170
It went well. Don't worry.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.930
She'll be sent to the ICU when she's ready.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.450
We'll keep an eye on her tonight,
and let's talk tomorrow.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.020
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.800
While checking her language function,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.050
I asked her to create a sentence using

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.980
Mom, I, and love. Those three words.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.580
And she said...

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.340
What's this?

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.010

first love.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.590
That made my heart flutter.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.710
Thank you.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.460
I drove Dr. Jung back home

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.510
and told her to come when
she's moving to a regular ward.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.760
I told you to go home and rest, too.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.820
My favorite place is by your side.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.960
Don't tell me to leave.

Oppa,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.300
when...

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.590
Hyo Ri said her head hurt,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.280
I told her to take a painkiller.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.270
I told her to take a painkiller and study.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.480
I said everyone endures pain and studies.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.050
I yelled at her for having a weak mindset.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.010
I'm so bad, huh?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.600
How do you like this bike?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.610
I'm thinking of getting one for Hyo Ri, too.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.690
She can take walks further away,
and it's a good exercise.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.550
Let's look into buying a car, too.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.300
We'll use it to go to the hospital,
and while she recovers,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.250
we might want to go on trips. You know?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.340
What a fool.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.830
I mean, me.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.390
I need to consider what Hyo Ri
will need in the future.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.320
I keep talking about the past I can't change

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.320
and wasting my energy.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.170
She's fighting a battle to come back to us.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.490
But I'm just talking about the past as her mom.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.590
How foolish.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.590
It's hard to be an adult.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.740
Being a parent is even harder.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.490
Whether it's out of pride or pretense,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.400
being parent makes you think
and endure things one more time.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.150
You aren't foolish. You're honest.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.560
That's how you slowly become a parent.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.240
She'll make sure to wake up.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.120
Why say something so obvious?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.830
I won't cry.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.660
It'll only drain Hyo Ri.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.170
It's okay to cry.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.290
She'll eventually come to you anyway.

- Yes.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.280

It's mom.

She wouldn't speak unless she needed to.

Drink healthy juice.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.220
I feel kind of tired today.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.930
No.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.930
Okay, let's start.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.520
Raise them up.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.290
Relax your shoulders. Stretch your back.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.510
- Stretch your tailbone.
- It feels good.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.690
To the left.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.610
Ji An, don't put your head on your arm.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.210
Cross the right leg.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.580
Sit straight, Ji An.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.170
How about my leg?

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.970
Okay. Twist.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.530
Hyungnim!

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.200
Hey. So hot.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.340
I harvested this corn this morning.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.430
Eat a few and...

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.110
sell the rest for us.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.180
10,000 won for a dozen.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.190
I won't make any profit.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.570
Make it 10. Make it 10.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.550
- Is that so?
- Let me look.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.290
- 10,000 won for 10?
- Yes, 10.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.580
Mr. Ryu is here.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.930
What? Do you have eyes in the back of your head?

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.040
How did you know?

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.550
She wasn't just born in the year of the dog.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.850
She was born in the year of the German Shepherd.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.300
You're here to get milk, right?
Take the stuff in the fridge.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.790
Didn't you get these today?

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.540
Aigoo, he's so quick. Seriously.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.230
They're the same thing.
There isn't a big difference.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.360
But still, the ones you got today must be fresher.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.200
They say the regular who left is
scarier than the new customer.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.630
I'm envious of your knowledge, Mr. Ryu.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.060
You'll deliver them to Hyo Ri's again today, right?

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:35.630
Wow, this is why they say midlife romance is scary.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.550
It's not midlife romance. She's my first love.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.050
I reunited with my first love after 30 years.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.570
First love? Right?

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.470
I knew it was something unusual.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.800
First what? First what?

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.260
First love. You know first love? First love.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.160
Of course, I know what it is.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.210
You might not know.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.940
You probably had your first love
during the Korean War.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.130
I...

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.500
I was born in '58, the year of the dog. Come on.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.520
You tease me a lot for being nice.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.210
You were obviously born in '46,
the year of the dog.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.180
He's so funny.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.820
Hey, my niece was born in '70.
People think we're the same age.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.940
Geez. Really. I'm serious.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.020
He's so good at teasing.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.090
He's the best.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.800
You can't do this to me, Ahjussi.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.930
I've always kept my promise.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.950
What?

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.550
The Rising Sun Attack? How dirty.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.870
It's not dirty. It's strategic.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.670
Hey, hey, hey.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.570
Geez.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.490
What a shame.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.210
Oh, yes.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.440
Are you okay?

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.430
Gosh, my knee is acting up these days.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.660
Geez. I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.280
Take this.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.240
Why are you whispering?

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.910
It's Auntie Seon Yeong's.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.750
She takes it for her joints these days.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.200
Two tablets?

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.850
You need to care for your joints in advance

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.490
to game with me for a long time.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.950
Gosh. You're the only one
who cares about me, Hyo Ri.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.000
It'd be too noticeable if I left this here.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.980
I'll take it with me.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.750
What's with you two?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.420
The milk was just an excuse, huh?

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.460
You come to game with Hyo Ri, don't you?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.680
That's not true.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.580
He goes through the trouble of picking up
milk for us. Come on, Mom.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.850
Milk helps kids grow taller, you know.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.200
He's right. I need to grow taller.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.660
We'll turn this off. Let's turn it off.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.440
We'll stop now.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.480
Okay.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.680
Talk quietly. Quietly.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.840
All right.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.210
Bo Hyeon.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.290
Oh, hello.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.510
I made this.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.670
It's not Seon Yeong's.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.700
I knew it.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.520
Is it good?

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.180
The bibimguksu tastes like bibimguksu.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.290
I feel like you're mocking me.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.810
It's just my insecurity, huh?

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.190
Saying bibimguksu tastes like
bibimguksu is the highest praise.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.330
Oh, okay.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.550
Hey, your dad is gaming with Hyo Ri again.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.160
Isn't he addicted at this rate?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.290
His eyes change when he plays games.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.020
This is no good.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.030
We'll put a screen time limit on his phone.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.170
We'll put the computer in the living room.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.650
Let's go shopping next week.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.260
Don't tell Dad. Just the two of us.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.060
Shopping with him makes you lose your temper.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.020
He tries on all the clothes at the shop.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.330
I know. It's not like he buys it afterward.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.300
It's so annoying when he just leaves.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.620
That's what I'm saying.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.900
That's why we should go without him.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.610
Okay.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.390
And when you drive to Seoul later,

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.590
take breaks if you feel tired.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:11.090
Don't drive sleepy to look cool.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.050
Okay.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.980
Wow, this is...

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.780
You eat so well. Must be tasty.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.530
Wow. Can't believe this taste.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.430
- Eat it all.
- Okay.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.300
- I'll make it for you again.
- Again?

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.020
Are you waiting for Bo Hyeon?

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.460
Yes.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.260
You must be going somewhere nice.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.120
I wanted to visit my old school.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.050
Hyo Ri,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.160
do you know why I become a doctor?

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.680
I got spectacular grades.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.720
Medicine was my profession.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.290
I tried living as best as I could.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.050
But when I was about to retire,

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:26.170
I realized I wasn't so good with the patients.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:32.290
I couldn't figure out the reason why.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.110
But I understand now that I'm a patient.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.350
The things I neglected as a doctor.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.150
The patients' lethargy.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.100
I thought that providing the answer based on

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.770
my knowledge was the best approach.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.610
But I was wrong.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:56.480
I should've understood their hopeless and

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.430
powerless feelings first.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.200
Understanding the indefinable fear.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.540
That should've been my first step
in approaching patients.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.290
That's why...

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.590
I think you'd be different from me.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.450
I'll stop now.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:29.040
Because I'm an advanced boomer
who knows when to stop.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.600
It went well, didn't it?

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.840
How did you know?

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.600
You know how much I'm into you.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.630
I can just tell from your face.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.510
- The dean asked...
- Yes.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.580
if I want to resume, even
after knowing how tough it is.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.360
- He asked if I'd regret.
- Yeah.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.190
So, I told him that...

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.300
I desperately need this extremely
challenging and tiring life back.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.860
That I think I can get back to it.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.600
Good job.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.850
It's okay if your current decision is wrong.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.340
You can figure things out again.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.530
Right?

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.540
That's different than regretting.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.740
I even know the secret of life that
most people don't know.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:35.800
Hardship isn't something you
overcome, fight, and defeat.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.670
You just need to accept that it's a part of life

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:44.440
and decide on your attitude toward it.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.510
You can't do this.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:51.840
You can't make my heart flutter
like this. It's hard.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.940
So, when will you tell Ahjumma?

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.880
I should tell her now.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.210
I didn't want Mom to wait anxiously.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.600
She's been anxious a lot because of me, anyway.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.820
She'd be happy.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.900
- You think so?
- Yeah.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.640
I want to tell you something, too.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.410
I want to try studying.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.570
There's a landscape design program
in Berlin that I wanted to join.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.550
I've been looking into it for two years.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.420
I sent my portfolio, and they reached
out and told me to apply.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.600
I'll have to go sooner to study the language.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.200
I want to apply for the next semester.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.200
Since you're making this cool decision,
I feel confident, too.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.990
Bo Hyeon...

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:55.360
you're the coolest...

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.190
when you talk about flowers, trees,

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.230
gardens, dirt, and stuff like that.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.560
I'm sure you'll have so much fun studying.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.230
This is great.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.130
Are you sad about us being apart?

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.690
No.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.730
To be honest, very much so.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.340
Me, too.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.970
But this is the right way.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.480
Shall we?

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.920
Yes.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.280
Wow. They're growing so well.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.920
Right? All on their own.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.240
Aren't you so proud of them?

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.390
How are they so smart?

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.080
Someone said this is how nature works.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.990
Gosh, you're so unsentimental.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.620
How will you survive
the 21st century, the era of EQ?

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.230
I know, huh?

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.600
- Are you done?
- I'm done. Let's go.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.370
Mom,

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.710
I think I'll go back to school.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:31.970
What?

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.480
To learn more about readmission,

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.470
I went to school and met with the dean today.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.870
No. It'd be too hard on you. You can't.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.530
Mom.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.570
I'm trying to live.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.800
I'm trying to live well, even.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.310
You know how difficult it is.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.030
Mom, I really want to do it.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.890
Rather than worrying about whether
I could do well or if it'd be too tough,

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.140
I really want to do it.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.830
Sharing the knowledge I learned by working hard.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.790
That's what I want to do.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.930
I won't abuse my body.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.050
I have you by my side.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.870
For Bo Hyeon, Auntie, Dr. Jung, Ahjussi,

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.290
I won't waste my body away for the sake
of people I love.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.880
I'll cherish it.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.400
You won't change your mind,
no matter what I say, right?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.800
No.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.450
Geez, you're just like me.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.660
I trust you, Hyo Ri.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.130
I knew you'd support me, Mom.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.540
So, Mom,

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.280
would you like to go somewhere with me on Sunday?

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.430
Right. Sook is coming tomorrow.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.350
Why? Does she miss my scolding?

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.110
Let's eat fruit. Let's eat fruit.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:05.200
Where's Dr. Jung? Dr. Jung, let's eat fruit!

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.170
- Dr. Jung!
- It's apples.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.890
Come eat. It's so tasty.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.930
Have some apples, Dr. Jung.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.220
It's delicious.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.680
Well, I have something to say.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:30.810
I'm thinking of going back to Seoul now.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.910
I've inconvenienced you a lot.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.040
I should go back to where I belong.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.780
I put the villa on the market.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:46.300
I'm looking for a place where
I could receive care in Seoul.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.990
Why? Why?

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.850
Why are you suddenly going to Seoul? Why?

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.410
Hyo Ri is doing well.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.600
And if I stayed here, I might end up
being a burden to you.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.430
- Dr. Jung, this is where you belong.
- Yes.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.400
Our relationship is special.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.310
We save, lean on, and support each other.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.760
Unlike a family that was just given to you,

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.880
relationships like ours, that were formed

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.640
through complicated connections are...

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.800
What do you call that? What do you call that?

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.360
Bbaebak*. You call it bbaebak.
(Means "getting stuck")

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.500
A relationship like this can't be sustained
if we didn't like each other a lot.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.740
It's bbaebak because we like each other, right?

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.610
Yes.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.080
If I stayed here-

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.670
It's because we like you.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.430
Not because we're grateful or feel guilty.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.160
It's not out of moral obligations, either.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.310
- It's because we like you a lot.
- Right.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.500
- So, live with us.
- Yes.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.800
Dr. Jung, we all know well.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.400
Delaying or holding back feelings
when you like someone is foolish.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.210
It's foolish.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:56.690
Because we like each other.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:00.730
Let's have fun and live together
since we like each other.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.960
If you feel uncomfortable around us,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.310
I have nothing to say, but...

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.820
Is that how it is, by chance?

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.590
Is that so?

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.490
No. Gosh, come on.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.810
Well, I...

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.690
Gosh, I also...

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.040
like you a lot, of course.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.420
She's confessing her love.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.940
Is this your first time?

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.860
Didn't your heart skip a beat?

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.540
There's no turning back once a heart skips a beat.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.610
No turning back.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.370
I can't let you go. I won't.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.130
Hold her tight. Don't go.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.820
I'll cry.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.560
Don't go. Why are you leaving?

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.130
Don't go.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.590
Why are you doing this?

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.370
Why? Seriously.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.530
Don't go.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:53.660
Can I cry?

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.440
Yes, Village Leader.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.680
Pardon?

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:03.560
O-Of course. Absolutely.

- It's skate. I'll get it for you.

[Nature is a Masterpiece]
Welcome.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.160
Ms. Lee, this is so great.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.940
Village Leader Go.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.010
Good, good.

Have a seat here.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.210
Good manners.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.350
Not bad, right? Isn't it tasty?

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.800
Enjoy.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.810
Let me know if you need anything.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.040
Okay.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.400
Gosh. I hope the food is to your liking.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.960
It's delicious and clean-tasting.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.820
We only use natural seasoning.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.140
Our food might taste more subtle.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.210
But we put a lot of time and effort into it.

You think we won't know since we're country folks?

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.610
You can tell by tasting it.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.130
Great cooking.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.740

- Hi.
- Hey, come on.

Did you come to greet me? Did you miss me?

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.580
Did you wait for me?

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:50.490
What took you so long?

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.910
Yo.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:57.360
Wow, Dong Seok. What's the deal?

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.570
I've zoned out watching water and fire,

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.790
but I've never been hypnotized by someone grilling.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.560
Wow. You're good.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.540
Don't be fooled.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.820
She's tricking you.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.410
She wants to eat a lot of meat.

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:12.900
So, she's trying to exploit you.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.840
- Hey.
- What?

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.000
She's way too good at reading the air.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.360
I'll get us ice cream. Ice cream.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.420
I-I want to pick one myself.

Where are you going?

First time in my life, I said.

Yes.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:53.200
It wasn't because you were nervous and afraid.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.750
Right?

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.080
It's okay.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.710

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.930
I've got nothing...

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.660
- What?
- Whoa. Gosh. What?

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.420
Stop right there!

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:51.150
Becoming each other's small miracle.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.500
It's so pretty.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.110
So pretty.

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:07.490
One, two, three.

01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:09.980
One, two, three.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.600
In the end, our best, second best,
and third best options

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:52.900
are to remember to discover
the happiness of the moment.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.800
Just to live freely, loving this magical day.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.760
That's all there is to it.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.940
Look at that.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:10.820
Just like our first love
that was full of sincerity.
