00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.677
(Previously)
How did you come from the future?

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.642
Or were you turned into a robot

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:04.797
and sent on a Time Machine

00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:06.141
to come back and do some mission?

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:07.369
Everyone.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:08.758
Phop is gone.

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:11.138
This time, I couldn't help you again.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.745
And don't worry.

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:15.032
Phop's shop will stay the same.

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:17.328
Practice hard, kids.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.377
Mom and I will be cheering for you.

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:20.555
I'm taking you to apply

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:21.865
for a scholarship to study abroad.

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:22.889
No.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.837
I really want to show my dad.

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:26.509
There's only one way, isn't there?

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:27.990

"Rearrange" (Episode 6)

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.624
"Get to the final round"

00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.344
I like you.

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.814
Travel safely.

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:37.894
Yes, goodbye Dad. Goodbye Mom.

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:41.267
Aek, you took the
mosquito repellent, right?

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:42.139
Yes, Mom.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.046
Flashlight?

00:03:43.112 --> 00:03:44.112
I took it.

00:03:44.994 --> 00:03:46.244
What about clean water?

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:47.811
Did you have Ton prepare it yet?

00:03:47.835 --> 00:03:49.213
I'm afraid that up there,

00:03:49.238 --> 00:03:51.511
you won't have clean
water to wash your face.

00:03:52.353 --> 00:03:53.015
Mom.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.320
You don't have to worry at all.

00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:57.008
Mmm, okay.

00:03:57.374 --> 00:04:00.158
If you want anything, Aek, just tell Ton.

00:04:00.183 --> 00:04:00.791
Okay.

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:02.271
I'm so worried.

00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:04.538
Hey, Aek.

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:06.898
It's not just Mom who's worried.

00:04:06.922 --> 00:04:08.177
Dad is worried too, you know.

00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:08.802
Okay.

00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:10.716
Go, you'll be late.

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.741
I'm going now, Mom.

00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:30.174
Chai.

00:04:35.564 --> 00:04:36.518
You forgot your hat.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:37.543
Hey.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.079
Thank you.

00:04:40.103 --> 00:04:41.312
How did you find it?

00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:43.084
Thank you.

00:04:47.546 --> 00:04:48.553
I'm going now.

00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:50.352
Okay.

00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:26.888
Lin.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.103
I think Nut

00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:31.649
seems like a good kid.

00:05:31.673 --> 00:05:33.157
I think he's nice.

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:35.215
And what do you think, Lin?

00:05:39.523 --> 00:05:40.644
Yes, Dad.

00:05:41.202 --> 00:05:43.169
Nut is a very good person.

00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:48.336
And how do you feel about Nut?

00:05:51.774 --> 00:05:53.503
What do you mean, Dad?

00:05:55.342 --> 00:05:57.158
He doesn't mean anything by it.

00:05:57.183 --> 00:05:59.086
He just wants to ask you

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.162
after you finish 12th grade,

00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:03.106
since you're going to
study in England together,

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:05.442
should you two get engaged?

00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:08.416
So you won't be the subject of town gossip.

00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:10.337
What do you think?

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:16.911
I...

00:06:18.564 --> 00:06:19.946
I'm late.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.006
Let's talk about this when I get back.

00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.521
Goodbye. Goodbye.

00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:32.867
Hey, why the sudden camping trip?

00:06:33.702 --> 00:06:35.872
Dad, you're asking now?

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.572
Isn't asking at any time the same?

00:06:39.158 --> 00:06:40.471
Well, yes.

00:06:40.757 --> 00:06:42.814
But if you change your mind now,

00:06:42.838 --> 00:06:44.032
it's too late, Dad.

00:06:45.298 --> 00:06:46.298
True.

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:49.424
I'm going to look for
inspiration to write a song.

00:06:49.928 --> 00:06:51.184
Because in the final round,

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:52.608
we have to use a new original song.

00:06:54.994 --> 00:06:55.994
How about this?

00:06:56.433 --> 00:06:58.193
If you want help, just let me know, okay?

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.301
Thank you very much.

00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:05.468
Why can't my dad understand me like this?

00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:15.016
Why don't you understand me?

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:17.368
Win, listen to me first, understand?

00:07:17.393 --> 00:07:18.831
I don't want to listen anymore, Dad.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.952
I already told you I
don't want to play music.

00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:22.271
Why do you keep pestering me?

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:23.424
You used to like playing.

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:24.904
So why the sudden change?

00:07:24.928 --> 00:07:26.002
Is it because of Nut?

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:27.711
It has nothing to do with Nut.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.467
Even if Nut hadn't died,

00:07:29.497 --> 00:07:30.971
I would have quit music anyway.

00:07:31.345 --> 00:07:32.733
Wait, wait, wait.

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:36.021
Shouldn't you think
about it carefully first?

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:39.436
I've thought it through, Dad.

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:41.982
If playing music means
having a life like yours,

00:07:42.364 --> 00:07:43.676
I'd rather do something else.

00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:57.655
Dad.

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:01.229
That song you're writing,

00:08:02.278 --> 00:08:03.298
how's it going?

00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:08.516
I'll sing it for you when
we get there, okay?

00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:20.056
Dad.

00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:22.443
If we had a motorcycle,
we could have driven right here.

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:23.761
We walked so far.

00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:24.699
Okay, I get it.

00:08:24.723 --> 00:08:26.123
But we're past that point now, son.

00:08:26.323 --> 00:08:28.163
At least we're here now.

00:08:28.188 --> 00:08:29.468
- Most importantly...
- Win, Nut.

00:08:29.649 --> 00:08:31.637
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello.

00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:32.970
How's the atmosphere?

00:08:32.994 --> 00:08:33.994
Is it amazing?

00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:36.018
Amazing, the atmosphere is great.

00:08:36.043 --> 00:08:37.441
The cool weather is just right.

00:08:38.327 --> 00:08:39.108
Dad.

00:08:39.132 --> 00:08:41.532
Should we find a spot to set up
the tent before it gets dark?

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.300
I'll leave this with you, Dad.

00:08:45.322 --> 00:08:47.029
Tim, go help me over there.

00:08:48.044 --> 00:08:48.746
See you.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.797
I'll help too.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.143
Get it done properly, Tim.

00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:56.240
Hey, have you guys been here long?

00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:57.666
A little while.

00:08:58.106 --> 00:08:59.843
So what were you thinking,

00:08:59.867 --> 00:09:01.798
coming all this way to celebrate a victory?

00:09:02.465 --> 00:09:04.519
We can't call it a victory celebration yet.

00:09:05.932 --> 00:09:07.252
We've only made it to the finals.

00:09:07.911 --> 00:09:08.911
Yeah, that's it.

00:09:10.198 --> 00:09:11.257
So tired.

00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:23.617
Tired.

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:26.259
But it's worth it, right?

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:28.149
Of course.

00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:33.882
It's more than worth it for you.

00:09:34.061 --> 00:09:35.069
Staring like that.

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:38.535
Let's go, help me set up the tent first.

00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:39.989
Before I help you,

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.583
I'll go help Lin first.

00:09:45.435 --> 00:09:46.575
Need any help?

00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:00.513
I'll poke it.

00:10:30.138 --> 00:10:31.318
Hey.

00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:33.357
Were you ever a boy scout?

00:10:34.812 --> 00:10:35.984
Never.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:38.859
Oh.

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:41.353
You're an international school kid.

00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:43.291
Give it to me.

00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:45.513
I'll teach you.

00:11:01.613 --> 00:11:02.613
Just this.

00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:04.861
Okay.

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:06.489
There, the fire is lit.

00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:12.695
Sorry, man.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.937
You want to play like this, right?

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:26.832
I have a lot of charcoal.

00:11:27.315 --> 00:11:28.757
Hey, man.

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:31.181
I didn't mean to.

00:11:31.241 --> 00:11:32.341
Look.

00:11:32.852 --> 00:11:33.827
You got more than me.

00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:34.854
Here, the other side.

00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:36.641
Come here.

00:11:37.382 --> 00:11:38.382
Come here.

00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:43.121
Come here now.

00:11:48.362 --> 00:11:50.177
Okay, all set.

00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:52.471
Hey, Dad.

00:11:52.863 --> 00:11:54.524
We only have one tent?

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:55.549
Yes.

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.424
Then how are we going to sleep?

00:11:57.448 --> 00:11:58.482
All 3 of us?

00:11:58.902 --> 00:12:00.529
Yes, we have to sleep together.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.118
When Tim was little,
we slept together like this.

00:12:03.142 --> 00:12:04.581
It's not a big deal, don't overthink it.

00:12:04.605 --> 00:12:06.658
Hey, but Tim is bigger now.

00:12:11.407 --> 00:12:12.642
Um...

00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:14.553
Actually, my tent...

00:12:15.894 --> 00:12:17.101
I'm staying alone.

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:21.121
Win, you can sleep with me.

00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:26.819
Um...

00:12:30.848 --> 00:12:31.848
Okay.

00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:35.209
Dad.

00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:36.267
Then...

00:12:36.609 --> 00:12:38.002
I'll sleep with Nut.

00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:41.561
Okay.

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:46.051
Are you satisfied now?

00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:49.501
Bring the stuff in.

00:12:53.126 --> 00:12:54.141
Ouch.

00:12:56.387 --> 00:12:58.054
Here, I'll help.

00:13:07.087 --> 00:13:08.579
Is something wrong, Lin?

00:13:08.696 --> 00:13:09.816
What are you thinking about?

00:13:10.843 --> 00:13:12.018
Nothing.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.543
I was just lost in thought.

00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:22.721
Biu.

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.287
I've finished starting the fire.

00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:26.325
Where's the pork?

00:13:26.674 --> 00:13:27.764
Pork?

00:13:27.788 --> 00:13:29.043
Was I supposed to buy it?

00:13:31.837 --> 00:13:33.290
You forgot again, didn't you?

00:13:36.932 --> 00:13:37.932
Go.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.081
Buy the pork.

00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:49.175
Have you been waiting long?

00:13:55.975 --> 00:13:57.125
Why are you looking at me?

00:13:57.627 --> 00:13:58.667
No reason.

00:13:59.342 --> 00:14:00.342
Here.

00:14:01.148 --> 00:14:02.948
This is your hat.

00:14:05.793 --> 00:14:06.880
What hat?

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:10.793
Hey.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.273
The one I told you about.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:14.039
It's yours.

00:14:14.538 --> 00:14:15.759
Thank you.

00:14:16.854 --> 00:14:18.143
Put this on, and then

00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:20.404
go buy pork with me.

00:14:22.932 --> 00:14:23.932
Let's go.

00:14:25.218 --> 00:14:26.752
Let's go buy pork.

00:14:28.521 --> 00:14:30.159
Biu always forgets.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.105
You know?

00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:52.170
I used to think that I
wanted to have a band,

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:55.754
and invite everyone to go camping,

00:14:56.394 --> 00:14:58.394
to sit and eat mookrata
like this for a long time.

00:14:59.624 --> 00:15:00.921
You...

00:15:01.493 --> 00:15:02.728
seem to know my heart.

00:15:05.698 --> 00:15:06.698
Honestly?

00:15:07.522 --> 00:15:08.622
I...

00:15:09.122 --> 00:15:10.446
know everything about your heart.

00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:16.164
Then, from 1 to 1,000,000,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.440
what number am I thinking of right now?

00:15:21.361 --> 00:15:22.962
1 to 1,000,000?

00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:25.679
Who could possibly know that?

00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:27.039
Hey, just try to guess.

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:31.639
Win.

00:15:32.157 --> 00:15:34.034
Go get some more firewood.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.699
The charcoal is almost gone.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.070
Sure.

00:15:55.211 --> 00:15:56.291
26.

00:15:58.733 --> 00:16:00.983
I'm guessing 26.

00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:04.995
Correct!

00:16:05.801 --> 00:16:06.716
26?

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.914
Yeah, correct.

00:16:07.938 --> 00:16:08.822
Really?

00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:09.496
Really.

00:16:09.521 --> 00:16:11.515
I don't believe you.
How could you be right?

00:16:11.908 --> 00:16:13.245
You like to lie to me.

00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:14.383
Seriously, am I right?

00:16:15.634 --> 00:16:17.758
Whatever number you guessed,
I'd say it was correct.

00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:19.453
See?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.503
See?

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:22.041
You like to lie to me.

00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:32.202
Win, I need to rest for a moment.

00:16:39.655 --> 00:16:40.680
Are you okay?

00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:44.763
Okay.

00:16:48.144 --> 00:16:50.144
Do you have something
you're not telling me about?

00:16:51.826 --> 00:16:52.933
No.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.266
You like to lie to me, Nut.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.260
Lying to you once today is enough.

00:17:03.955 --> 00:17:05.304
The sun is just strong.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.383
So I just want to rest.

00:17:15.588 --> 00:17:16.588
You know?

00:17:19.007 --> 00:17:20.513
Why I wanted to come here?

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:25.778
Why?

00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:31.716
When I was a kid, I came here with my dad.

00:17:34.313 --> 00:17:35.313
Back then,

00:17:35.891 --> 00:17:37.611
the river was much more beautiful than now.

00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:45.400
Have you ever had a moment like this

00:17:45.424 --> 00:17:46.592
with your dad?

00:17:56.391 --> 00:17:57.938
My dad wasn't like this back then.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.390
You know?

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:03.987
My dad once said that

00:18:05.204 --> 00:18:06.993
if we shout our wishes by this river,

00:18:07.764 --> 00:18:08.964
the wishes will come true.

00:18:10.845 --> 00:18:13.495
And what did you wish for back then?

00:18:16.278 --> 00:18:17.772
To be the number 1 guitarist.

00:18:20.704 --> 00:18:22.648
And your dad didn't scold you badly then?

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.964
My dad didn't say anything. Confusing?

00:18:29.765 --> 00:18:30.765
Honestly,

00:18:31.705 --> 00:18:34.107
I kind of get it.

00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:39.092
When grow up, as time passes,

00:18:40.943 --> 00:18:42.526
your thoughts and everything change.

00:18:45.727 --> 00:18:47.589
Why do you talk like an old man?

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:51.259
Well, actually,

00:18:51.932 --> 00:18:53.099
I am old.

00:18:53.458 --> 00:18:54.637
I'm 40 years old.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.015
Should I believe you?

00:19:12.521 --> 00:19:13.548
I'll be right back.

00:19:19.929 --> 00:19:22.336
I wish for our band to win.

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:25.023
I wish for Nut to be healthy.

00:19:36.037 --> 00:19:38.244
I wish for Win to stop overthinking.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.258
I wish to be the number 1 guitarist.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.290
Can I leave this with you, sir?

00:19:44.337 --> 00:19:45.603
Just put it down.

00:19:47.337 --> 00:19:49.717
I wish I could finally dare
to follow my own heart.

00:19:52.243 --> 00:19:54.591
I wish I had more courage.

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:57.837
You still don't have enough courage?

00:19:57.936 --> 00:19:58.651
Yeah.

00:19:58.676 --> 00:19:59.810
I still don't dare to run shirtless

00:19:59.834 --> 00:20:01.217
in front of the house like you.

00:20:02.496 --> 00:20:03.822
You've done something like that?

00:20:05.373 --> 00:20:07.746
I wish for free booze.

00:20:08.463 --> 00:20:10.556
I wish I could play the drums forever.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.334
Forever?

00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:13.899
Yes.

00:20:17.362 --> 00:20:18.362
Dad.

00:20:18.388 --> 00:20:19.194
What is it?

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.646
What are they doing?

00:20:25.601 --> 00:20:27.235
They are in the process of

00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:28.801
unlocking.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.170
Unlocking themselves.

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:33.742
What is unlocking, Dad?

00:20:35.277 --> 00:20:36.564
You'll find out soon enough.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:22.683
How's it going?

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.506
Now that you're here,

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.051
have you gotten more
inspiration to write songs?

00:21:29.942 --> 00:21:31.391
I have no idea what to write about.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.890
What do you usually do?

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.973
I...

00:21:40.603 --> 00:21:41.843
write from my feelings.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.616
Feelings.

00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:47.411
What kind of feelings?

00:21:50.015 --> 00:21:51.395
Like how you feel.

00:21:56.115 --> 00:21:57.702
Then...

00:21:59.428 --> 00:22:00.708
Then it must be a love song.

00:22:04.174 --> 00:22:05.591
A love song is good.

00:22:11.647 --> 00:22:12.694
Hey, guys.

00:22:13.307 --> 00:22:15.060
Actually, I have a song of my own.

00:22:16.297 --> 00:22:17.445
Want to hear it?

00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:19.923
Sure, bring it on.

00:22:28.895 --> 00:22:32.269

00:22:36.465 --> 00:22:39.185

How's my song?

00:22:54.524 --> 00:22:55.748
How about that?

00:22:56.525 --> 00:22:58.339
Beautiful, very beautiful.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.166
Thank you, sir.

00:23:00.191 --> 00:23:00.995
See?

00:23:01.019 --> 00:23:02.500
But don't sing it anywhere else.

00:23:02.525 --> 00:23:03.987
Or the police might come and arrest you.

00:23:04.011 --> 00:23:05.712
Hey, sir.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.537
Since you said that, let me hear a song.

00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:11.495
Win, play for me.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.058
What chords, Dad?

00:23:15.698 --> 00:23:17.694
Let's go with...

00:23:17.718 --> 00:23:19.346
C sharp and F sharp.

00:23:31.246 --> 00:23:32.246
Okay?

00:23:33.053 --> 00:23:34.180

You'll be okay, right?

00:24:16.646 --> 00:24:17.793
I'll be okay.

00:24:20.438 --> 00:24:21.873
I'm very good at being alone.

00:24:47.471 --> 00:24:49.225
Hey, Win.

00:24:49.662 --> 00:24:50.662
Win.

00:24:51.803 --> 00:24:53.143
Is the song that sad?

00:24:55.277 --> 00:24:56.417
Well...

00:24:58.605 --> 00:24:59.986
The lyrics are sad.

00:25:01.188 --> 00:25:02.645
It's not a sad song.

00:25:02.975 --> 00:25:04.356
It's a love song.

00:25:05.231 --> 00:25:07.071
No matter how I listen, it's a sad song.

00:25:07.826 --> 00:25:09.234
How can it be sad?

00:25:09.611 --> 00:25:11.053
I wrote it for my wife.

00:25:14.067 --> 00:25:15.220
So, do you like it?

00:25:15.928 --> 00:25:16.928
I like it a lot.

00:25:17.341 --> 00:25:19.033
Then here, I'll give it to you.

00:25:19.057 --> 00:25:20.153
Go ahead and finish it.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.720
I've only written up to this point.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.921
Are you serious?

00:25:32.066 --> 00:25:33.609
It's late, kids. Go to bed.

00:25:33.633 --> 00:25:34.633
You go first.

00:25:46.583 --> 00:25:48.776
Okay.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.660
Want some mosquito repellent?

00:26:03.423 --> 00:26:04.423
I'll put it on for you.

00:26:08.457 --> 00:26:09.530
Give me your arm.

00:26:11.471 --> 00:26:12.471
Give it here.

00:26:24.195 --> 00:26:25.714
We...

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.380
should go to bed.

00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:30.442
Are you scared of ghosts?

00:26:30.715 --> 00:26:31.903
Don't say that.

00:26:32.428 --> 00:26:33.766
I'm trying not to think about it.

00:26:36.884 --> 00:26:38.030
And you're not scared?

00:26:39.199 --> 00:26:40.245
I am scared.

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:42.211
But I've never seen one.

00:26:42.457 --> 00:26:44.775
If I saw one, I'd probably be more scared.

00:26:46.421 --> 00:26:47.629
Have you ever seen one, Lin?

00:26:48.296 --> 00:26:49.916
Come on, let's not talk about this.

00:26:52.404 --> 00:26:54.679
But I don't think ghosts are real.

00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:56.938
Because if ghosts were real,

00:26:59.029 --> 00:27:01.026
my grandparents would have visited by now.

00:27:02.306 --> 00:27:04.576
Maybe they just don't want to scare you.

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:07.581
Like, thinking it's better not to appear.

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:09.940
Letting you live a peaceful life.

00:27:14.036 --> 00:27:15.090
No way.

00:27:17.803 --> 00:27:19.643
My grandma definitely
knows I want to see her.

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:28.112
Hey, guys.

00:27:29.955 --> 00:27:30.955
Can I ask you something?

00:27:35.307 --> 00:27:37.215
If one day I died,

00:27:40.419 --> 00:27:41.805
would you want me to visit you?

00:27:42.438 --> 00:27:43.423
Death again.

00:27:43.447 --> 00:27:44.983
What's wrong with you today?

00:27:45.007 --> 00:27:46.342
Talking about death so often.

00:27:46.914 --> 00:27:47.967
We're talking about ghosts,

00:27:47.991 --> 00:27:49.591
so it has to be related to death, right?

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.460
Oh, right.

00:27:52.657 --> 00:27:53.657
No way.

00:27:53.944 --> 00:27:55.039
Don't come visit me.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.788
But for me, you can visit.

00:27:57.812 --> 00:27:59.503
But please be in good condition.

00:27:59.527 --> 00:28:00.620
Not with a messed up face.

00:28:00.869 --> 00:28:03.235
And give me the lottery
numbers for a small prize.

00:28:03.259 --> 00:28:05.635
No, I want the grand prize.

00:28:20.505 --> 00:28:21.792
You wouldn't visit me.

00:28:29.325 --> 00:28:30.392
I mean,

00:28:31.235 --> 00:28:32.346
someone like you,

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.090
you probably like watching concerts, right?

00:28:34.557 --> 00:28:35.967
You'd probably go haunt

00:28:35.991 --> 00:28:37.749
the places where there are concerts.

00:28:37.773 --> 00:28:38.917
So you can watch for free.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.934
Yeah.

00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:43.559
Being a ghost is pretty good too.

00:28:44.691 --> 00:28:45.691
Right?

00:28:46.644 --> 00:28:48.298
I can get free booze, right?

00:28:48.323 --> 00:28:49.963
But someone has to light incense for you.

00:28:50.777 --> 00:28:51.777
Do you think

00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:53.838
a ghost can get drunk from drinking?

00:28:54.062 --> 00:28:55.062
That's enough.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.497
I'm going to bed.

00:28:58.078 --> 00:28:59.545
I'll go with you, Lin.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.080
Where are you going? Hey.

00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:05.880
Where was my joke not funny?

00:29:07.302 --> 00:29:08.489
Not funny at all.

00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:35.830
That conversation just now was so scary.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.980
Why are you afraid of ghosts?

00:29:39.483 --> 00:29:40.684
Have you seen one?

00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:44.605
Not exactly seeing one.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.104
But at that time,

00:29:47.128 --> 00:29:48.890
I was camping with my family.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.732
And suddenly I heard someone
walking outside the tent.

00:29:52.452 --> 00:29:54.353
But when I opened it, no one was there.

00:29:55.768 --> 00:29:58.710
Since then, whenever I
go camping in the forest,

00:29:58.895 --> 00:30:00.456
I've always been scared.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:09.718
See?

00:30:09.742 --> 00:30:11.190
It was just like this back then.

00:30:14.858 --> 00:30:15.932
Biu.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.120
Wait a minute, Lin.

00:30:34.246 --> 00:30:35.492
Ouch.

00:30:36.046 --> 00:30:37.926
Damn it.

00:30:37.951 --> 00:30:39.412
What are you playing at?

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:43.103
I'm a person, not a ghost.

00:30:44.499 --> 00:30:45.659
My eye.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.482
I'm not playing anymore.

00:30:49.606 --> 00:30:50.980
You won't have anything to cover.

00:30:53.356 --> 00:30:54.889
Go back to sleep.

00:31:10.024 --> 00:31:12.524
So small, but punches so damn hard.

00:31:30.235 --> 00:31:31.402
Chai.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.483
Why are you here?

00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:37.639
Actually, I have a secret to tell you.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.036
- I'm scared of ghosts.
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:31:44.999 --> 00:31:47.374
What happened to your face?

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.073
Ouch.

00:31:52.153 --> 00:31:53.326
It hurts.

00:31:55.763 --> 00:31:57.918
Then wait a minute.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.618
How was it?

00:32:03.871 --> 00:32:04.871
Did you see anything?

00:32:06.253 --> 00:32:07.253
I did.

00:32:07.878 --> 00:32:09.084
What did you do?

00:32:10.052 --> 00:32:11.392
I already punched it.

00:32:13.585 --> 00:32:14.965
Let's sleep, Lin.

00:32:15.144 --> 00:32:16.144
It's nothing.

00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:52.404
You brought a first-aid kit?

00:32:53.561 --> 00:32:55.175
My mom prepared everything.

00:33:03.883 --> 00:33:04.976
Gently.

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:09.486
All done.

00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:14.380
Chai.

00:33:15.406 --> 00:33:16.886
Even up here on the mountain,

00:33:17.566 --> 00:33:19.267
you still manage to get into trouble.

00:33:21.277 --> 00:33:22.837
Or do you want to have trouble with me?

00:33:23.461 --> 00:33:24.528
Want some?

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.749
No.

00:33:26.773 --> 00:33:28.514
I don't want to bully a kid.

00:33:31.797 --> 00:33:32.865
Let's sleep.

00:34:18.754 --> 00:34:20.234
Are you cold?

00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:34.508
You guessed wrong earlier.

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:37.976
Guessed what?

00:34:40.386 --> 00:34:41.588
That if I died,

00:34:42.315 --> 00:34:43.821
I would still come back to you.

00:34:50.328 --> 00:34:51.676
You wouldn't come back to me.

00:34:52.163 --> 00:34:53.163
Trust me.

00:34:57.144 --> 00:34:58.464
Come on, let me apply it for you.

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.455
So your dark circles can finally disappear.

00:35:20.983 --> 00:35:22.583
Let's hurry up and sleep, I'm very cold.

00:35:23.613 --> 00:35:24.613
Okay.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.375
Tomorrow, if you wake up first,

00:35:32.621 --> 00:35:33.762
don't wake me up.

00:36:06.185 --> 00:36:07.441
But you once said that

00:36:09.362 --> 00:36:10.962
if there's no surgery, it's okay, right?

00:36:11.937 --> 00:36:12.867
That's right.

00:36:12.891 --> 00:36:15.610
Only in cases where the
tumor doesn't have any effect.

00:36:16.444 --> 00:36:18.941
But now, abnormal symptoms
are starting to appear.

00:36:19.465 --> 00:36:21.312
I recommend surgery.

00:36:26.399 --> 00:36:27.700
So if I have surgery,

00:36:29.493 --> 00:36:31.573
will I still be able to play
the guitar like before?

00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:34.617
I can't answer that yet.

00:36:43.767 --> 00:36:44.875
Doctor.

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:49.084
I'm asking for just 3 months.

00:36:50.981 --> 00:36:52.181
After the competition is over,

00:36:52.987 --> 00:36:54.290
I will tell my father

00:36:55.134 --> 00:36:56.315
and then I will have surgery.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.393
But in the meantime,

00:37:03.322 --> 00:37:04.908
can you please keep this a secret?

00:37:46.255 --> 00:37:47.595
Are you cold?

00:37:56.779 --> 00:37:58.066
Your hands are so cold.

00:38:02.512 --> 00:38:04.545
I guess the blanket I
brought is a bit too thin.

00:38:05.285 --> 00:38:06.718
I didn't think it would be cold.

00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:13.076
Then...

00:38:13.669 --> 00:38:15.378
do you want to use my blanket?

00:38:16.449 --> 00:38:17.695
It's probably thicker.

00:38:19.285 --> 00:38:20.285
Hey.

00:38:20.505 --> 00:38:22.165
Why would I take it from you?

00:38:28.583 --> 00:38:29.794
My blanket

00:38:30.233 --> 00:38:32.312
is huge. You're not taking it.

00:38:46.141 --> 00:38:47.155
Is that better?

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.957
A little better.

00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:08.978
I have warm hands.

00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:12.901
You can hold my hand like this.

00:39:14.196 --> 00:39:15.209
So you won't be cold.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.808
Good night.

00:40:00.402 --> 00:40:03.241
1, 2, 3.

00:40:04.352 --> 00:40:05.732
Let me get a vertical one too.

00:40:07.336 --> 00:40:10.396
1, 2, 3.

00:40:17.235 --> 00:40:20.103
1, 2, 3.

00:40:21.467 --> 00:40:22.597
Taking this many pictures,

00:40:22.621 --> 00:40:23.861
the film roll must be finished.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.552
It's okay if it's finished.

00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:27.150
I've taken pictures of everyone.

00:40:28.107 --> 00:40:29.400
Have you counted yourself?

00:40:30.231 --> 00:40:32.450
Oh, I forgot to count.

00:40:32.475 --> 00:40:33.917
Come on, I'll take one for you.

00:40:35.392 --> 00:40:36.427
Why?

00:40:36.886 --> 00:40:38.846
Didn't you like the one
I took for you last time?

00:40:39.308 --> 00:40:40.388
I liked it.

00:40:42.092 --> 00:40:43.252
Then let's take one together.

00:40:43.783 --> 00:40:44.783
Sure.

00:40:51.385 --> 00:40:53.187
1, 2, 3.

00:40:54.724 --> 00:40:55.944
One more picture.

00:40:59.376 --> 00:41:00.516
1, 2, 3.

00:41:02.558 --> 00:41:03.645
Oh.

00:41:04.033 --> 00:41:05.140
Nut.

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:12.049
What are you doing?

00:41:12.552 --> 00:41:14.372
Continuing the song from yesterday.

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:15.905
Want to help?

00:41:16.465 --> 00:41:17.679
I've written up to here.

00:41:31.891 --> 00:41:33.140
Boo!

00:41:33.523 --> 00:41:34.992
You scared me.

00:41:35.016 --> 00:41:37.160
What would you do if I
died of a heart attack?

00:41:38.767 --> 00:41:40.653
You won't die that easily.

00:41:40.677 --> 00:41:42.726
You'll live until you're 40.

00:41:44.291 --> 00:41:46.694
Next time, make some noise
when you show up, old man.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.086
Who's an old man?

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.748
You are, Uncle Win.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.694
You got me, I can't even argue.

00:42:00.821 --> 00:42:02.772
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:42:14.052 --> 00:42:15.580
In the next 20 years,

00:42:15.604 --> 00:42:16.959
Lin and Nut...

00:42:17.353 --> 00:42:18.459
I already told you.

00:42:19.333 --> 00:42:21.588
That you'll find out when the time comes.

00:42:22.725 --> 00:42:24.815
Damn, if it were me,

00:42:24.839 --> 00:42:26.159
I would have told you everything.

00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:27.848
Why are you holding back?

00:42:37.229 --> 00:42:38.276
Win, Win.

00:42:58.263 --> 00:43:00.016
Haven't you guys packed up yet?

00:43:00.604 --> 00:43:02.404
I have to play at the
bar later this evening.

00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:04.392
If you're slow, I'm not waiting.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.384
Yeah, I'll pack up quickly.

00:43:07.297 --> 00:43:08.677
Listen to this song first.

00:43:08.816 --> 00:43:10.096
Lin helped me write it just now.

00:43:10.479 --> 00:43:11.546

Thank you.

00:44:41.759 --> 00:44:42.891
I've been writing for so long

00:44:42.915 --> 00:44:44.184
and it's not even this good.

00:44:45.673 --> 00:44:48.731
Well, you wrote it well from the beginning.

00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:50.664
Sweet talker.

00:44:51.417 --> 00:44:53.383
See? I told you it's not a sad song.

00:44:53.407 --> 00:44:54.358
It's a love song.

00:44:54.382 --> 00:44:55.650
Do you understand now?

00:44:56.065 --> 00:44:56.878
I understand now.

00:44:56.903 --> 00:44:57.903
Awesome.

00:44:58.153 --> 00:44:59.373
Very good.

00:44:59.398 --> 00:45:00.532
What does everyone think?

00:45:01.005 --> 00:45:03.085
If it's okay, I'll continue
writing the second half.

00:45:04.758 --> 00:45:05.772
I think...

00:45:08.055 --> 00:45:09.248
it's so beautiful.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.131
Let's use this song for the final round.

00:45:16.877 --> 00:45:19.429
I think we'll definitely be the champions.

00:45:19.669 --> 00:45:20.669
Don't you think so?

00:45:22.464 --> 00:45:23.984
It's very beautiful.

00:45:44.042 --> 00:45:44.950
Win.

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:46.482
What is it, Lin?

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:48.770
Well,

00:45:49.526 --> 00:45:51.246
I have something to consult with you about.

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.317
Sure.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.450
I think...

00:45:58.473 --> 00:45:59.693
I like Nut.

00:46:02.184 --> 00:46:03.804
I want to confess my love.

00:46:05.277 --> 00:46:07.170
Can you help me find the right moment?

00:46:13.598 --> 00:46:15.887
Can you just play continuously?

00:46:15.955 --> 00:46:16.816
Yes.

00:46:16.841 --> 00:46:18.694
One song, and let it run continuously.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.083
Of course, Lin.

00:47:04.325 --> 00:47:06.005
(Next Episode)
Are you not free these days?

00:47:06.302 --> 00:47:08.622
I haven't eaten your stir-fried
vegetables in a long time.

00:47:08.699 --> 00:47:10.750
Nut, I have something to tell you.

00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:12.532
Are you okay?

00:47:12.789 --> 00:47:14.064
You seem distracted.

00:47:14.315 --> 00:47:16.381
Today, I feel like Win is
too stressed, don't you?

00:47:16.876 --> 00:47:18.690
Do you know what's wrong with Win?

00:47:26.685 --> 00:47:28.738
How could you let me be a fool like this?

00:47:30.162 --> 00:47:30.950
Hello, ma'am.

00:47:30.975 --> 00:47:32.183
I don't think it's convenient for you

00:47:32.207 --> 00:47:34.074
