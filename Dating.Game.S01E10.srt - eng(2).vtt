00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.360
It's #banyukagame…

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.160
"Yuka's real identity

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.200
is Boss Junji,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.680
the famous CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand."

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.120
Our parent company wants
to hold a press conference.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.360
You came here just to lecture me?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.160
I came here to ask for your help.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080
I’m…

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.080
dating Phat.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.560
Bay, don’t say it.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.320
I’m the one who started it.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.520
So, I have to fix it.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.480
Everyone

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.960
will understand you.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.240
- Any excuses?
- Or justifications?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.080
How do you plan on fixing this?

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.600
Yes. I am Yuka.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.760
That's the truth.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.720
- Man.
- Damn.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.000
Were the gamers

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.040
actually flirting with Mr. Junji, not Yuka?

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.680
Any compensation for the players?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.560
- That's right.
- Yeah!

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.080
- What do you say?
- Your solution?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.520
- Any policy to compensate users?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.440
- Please tell us!
- What's the policy?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.040
- Please explain.
- Please tell us!

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.600
What do you say?

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.640
Mr. Junji?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.200
- Say something.
- Any compensation?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.400
[reporters shouting questions]

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.080
Why did you let this happen?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.200
- Please explain.
- Please say something.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.760
Hey, this isn’t what we agreed on.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.920
You know, that's the real Yuka.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.680
She'd never lie

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.720
to someone who loves

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.080
and believes in herself.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.720
Do you really have to go?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.680
I have to take responsibility.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.680
But if you leave,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.800
then I will…

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.440
Hold on, Boss.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.320
Stop packing up.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.320
The tide has turned.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.160
Really?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.360
It's true.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.120
The tables have turned…

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.880
Junji Fever's going viral.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.080
With #savejunji trending in Thailand

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.880
as well as in Japan.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.160
That’s right.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.240
We're receiving calls nonstop

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.440
about events and endorsements.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.360
But our parent company won't agree.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.080
Forget them!

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.160
Downloads of "Yuka! Love Me Please"

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.520
just hit an all-time high.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.560
It broke every record.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.680
If they still complain…

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.520
They're idiots.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.960
Mr. Bay.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.640
Don’t speak ill of them.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.840
Yes, Boss.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.760
Anyway, no need to pack your things.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.000
You’re not leaving.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.280
So this means

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.560
everyone has

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.360
felt Junji's sincerity

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.600
and chose to support him?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.160
That’s wonderful.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.680
[both clear their throats]

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.240
You two.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.120
Thank you.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.200
Please clarify.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.400
How will you compensate?

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.440
Please explain.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.440
I’m sorry.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.440
Junji.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.480
Hill.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.600
Given what happened,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.000
I really thank you all.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.720
For this meeting,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.800
I have good news

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.640
and

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.800
bad news to share.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.760
So…

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.400
Do we get to choose

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.120
which one we'll hear first?

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.400
No.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.000
I'm sharing both in one go.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.240
You’ll see why.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.040
Can’t we hear only the good news?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.120
Please?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.480
None of us here

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.520
wants any more bad news.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.160
Exactly.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.880
From Yuka’s buzz,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.080
Japan wants us to

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.640
speed up the Beta launch of

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640
the new game.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.840
Alright.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.880
Well, how much earlier

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.360
are we talking?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.840
Well,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.880
three months sooner.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.640
Hang on, Boss.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.720
The launch was

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.800
set for next year, wasn't it?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.560
Right.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.080
So we speed up.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.000
But three months? Impossible.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.280
But three months? Impossible.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.800
Three months sooner.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.720
Which month is it now?

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.280
You mean

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.400
we only have six weeks to work on it?

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.760
Boss,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.000
you need to call Japan

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.520
and tell them it’s impossible!

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.880
Our job

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.440
is to make it possible.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.360
I believe in all of you.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.320
And now we have both Jeans and Art

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.480
joining the team.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.080
Can we really trust him?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:39.640
Hey.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.440
It won’t matter if

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.800
we can’t make it through.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.880
Ganbatte ne!

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.000
Ganbatte ne!

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.960
Ganbatte ne!

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560
An all-nighter.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.960
That's great.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.520
Cool.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.480
We got this!

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.280
Mom.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.200
You're heading out again?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.400
Yes.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.440
But I won’t be late.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.320
Don’t worry.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.400
I’m not worried!

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.680
Come on.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.880
You're not the daughter,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.040
and I'm not your dad.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.160
I do feel a bit guilty.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.440
Why?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.520
Where are you going?

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.480
A date, maybe?

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.040
You could call it that.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.920
I’m off on my date!

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.840
Have fun.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.520
Thanks.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.240
Look at her.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.800
Don't want her going out on dates?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.800
That's not it.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.720
You should’ve seen her before.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.160
She used to grill me every time I left.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.920
Where?

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.720
With whom?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.960
Is it a date?

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.160
I see.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.800
So, you ever date anyone?

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.840
How could I?

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.240
Afraid she wouldn't approve.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.800
But she’s fine with it now.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.280
And now this?

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.480
What a perfect timing.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.360
Leaving me to handle business

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.680
while she’s out on a date!

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.400
I mean, she and Pim promised to help.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.400
Then,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.080
I could help.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360
No need.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.000
Aren’t you busy yourself?

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.000
A bit.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
But I’m done

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.560
with today’s work.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.240
That fast?

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040
Of course.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.920
I’m a genius.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.840
Mine’s not done yet.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.760
I really can help.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360
No need.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.000
You'll just get in the way.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.440
You'll just get in the way.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.360
Bay.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.760
Bay.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.480
Bay.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.280
Phat.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.360
No.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.320
Stay still.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.760
Let me recharge a bit.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.320
You told me not to move.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.280
And then you do this.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.560
Am I supposed to just endure it?

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.920
Once I’m recharged,

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.360
we'll go on a date.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.000
A date?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.840
Boo!

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.040
What are you doing?!

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.160
Listen.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.640
Never been to a thrift shop?

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:09.760
Never.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.120
I really love thrifting.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.200
It feels like a treasure hunt.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.000
Really?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.960
Yeah.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.560
Let's make it a game.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.480
A game?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.960
I’ve wanted to try this forever.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.640
So, we set a target.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.240
And whoever finds it first

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.480
gets the point.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.920
Most points wins.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.080
And what of the prize?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.760
Well,

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.360
the loser has to do as the winner says.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.240
Deal?

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:38.960
Deal.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.480
Alright, the first one.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920
Dolphin.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.400
- Dolphin.
- Dolphin!

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.160
Dolphin.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.240
Dolphin?

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.280
Dolphin.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.520
These are women’s.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.520
Oh.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.000
Where are you going?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Oh damn.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.560
This one?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.280
Found it!

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.760
Dolphin!

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.440
It's my win.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.240
You'll have to do whatever I say.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:19.680
Alright?

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:20.840
Sure.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.720
Excuse me.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.720
You like it?

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:40.720
Yeah.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.320
I’ll buy it for you.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.720
No, that’s fine.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.680
Hey.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.640
You lost the game.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.680
So follow my rules.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.960
Isn’t it the other way around?

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.560
Here, choose one and I'll buy it.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.800
I'll buy this.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.160
But it's for you.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.240
What kind of rule is that?

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.520
Why do I get a reward?

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.000
Better get used to it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.400
Better get used to it.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.920
You’re my boyfriend.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.200
I’ll spoil you rotten.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:06.520
Here.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.040
This one, please.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.280
Got it. Cashless payment?

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.280
Yes, please.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:10.880
Alright.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.520
Okay.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:15.960
All good?

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.360
- Yes, thank you.
- Thanks.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:18.560
Here.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.440
Thanks.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.920
Check this out, Bay.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.120
The #junjifandom.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.440
It's trending right now.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.840
Junji Fandom.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.680
What?

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.080
What the hell...

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.360
Let's go.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.040
Isn't it cute?

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.600
My lucky shirt.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.800
Look at that!

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.280
Show me.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.560
Yours a bit big.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:24.880
[fans screaming Junji's name]

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.600
Please wait.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.560
Stay calm.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.720
[fans continue to call for Junji]

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.760
Wait a moment.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.920
[fans continue to scream]

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.640
Pao!

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.760
Wow.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.120
They’re all here waiting for Junji-san?

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.240
Guess so.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.040
He might even outshine Moo Deng.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.360
There's so many of them.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.160
Hill.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.880
Let's go.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.480
Help me find a way.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.200
- So crowded.
- Wait.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.120
You haven't gone in?

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.680
Nope.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.880
Damn.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.760
How do we do this?

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.160
Excuse me.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.000
You work for Junji, right?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.320
You work for Junji, right?

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:01.720
Yes.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.280
Perfect.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.040
Then,

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.160
could you give this to him for me?

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160
Sure.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.560
Once Junji gets it,

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.000
please take a photo

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.960
and post it with #junjifandom for me.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.720
Please?

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.640
Of course.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.080
- Can you give him this?
- This too?

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.320
- Please.
- This one too.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.560
For Junji, please.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.840
I'll help.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.480
Thank you.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.360
- Here you go.
- This one too.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.040
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks a lot.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.120
Got it, got it.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.360
There's so many!

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.480
- Yeah, I got it.
- Here, I got it.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.520
- Thank you so much.
- Alright, I got it.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320
Come on.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.640
Be careful.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:50.880
[fans screaming continuously]

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.720
This guy works for Junji.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.000
So cute.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.480
Could they be

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.000
more than just a Boss and a staff?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.160
more than just a Boss and a staff?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.920
Hill x Junji!

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.560
They both look so good.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.880
Oh my god.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.960
The ship has sailed!

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.160
Junji’s fans are packed outside.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.200
Oops.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.800
They also asked me to hand you these gifts.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080
Hill.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.960
What does “the ship has sailed” mean?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.560
A ship?

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.320
Yeah.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.640
It means,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.800
the fans are shipping you and Hill.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.000
But,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.640
why is it a ship?

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.440
Well,

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.400
this "ship" comes from "relationship".

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.560
Meaning,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.000
the fans pair you up

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.400
and imagine you two in relationship.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.200
And also

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.880
hoping to see some sweet moments.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.080
But

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.320
I never did anything

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.680
or say anything to the fans.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.000
Ms. Secretary.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.200
Ms. Secretary.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.800
Release this to our social media,

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.680
"I won't be accepting any gifts."

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.960
Understood, Boss.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.440
You don’t like it?

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.640
I’m not an idol.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.520
And

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.320
about them pairing us up,

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.880
does it bother you?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.360
That's—

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.240
Not really.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.240
Just…

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.000
Are you blushing?

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.040
No.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.800
I’m just

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.520
surprised.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.480
How did they know?

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.640
See? You are blushing.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.840
Then,

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.800
should we tell them?

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.920
That we’re dating?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.120
Aren't we obvious enough?

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.600
I'd rather

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.480
keep it this way.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.320
Are you okay with that?

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.200
Yeah.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.360
Work is work.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.840
Private matter is private.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.520
As long as we understand each other.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.080
Alright then.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.400
Junji-san.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.000
Whatever you want from me,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.600
I'll make sure to deliver.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.640
Just 11, 12, and 13.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.400
For now. As for…

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.080
…in the U.S. forms.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.240
- Right, U.S.
- Oh, U.S.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.520
Put them here before Boss scolds us.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.960
Hill.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.280
You can head home first.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.960
No, I’ll stay.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.120
Everyone’s still working anyway.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.280
But you,

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.760
you’ve been staying late for days.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.040
Why not leave early for once?

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880
I can’t.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.000
Everyone else

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.560
is still here.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.600
Hill.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.840
Don’t worry.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.040
How can I not?

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.440
My Boss is overworking himself.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.840
You’ll get sick.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.560
I’m fine.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.960
This is nothing.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.200
The one you should worry about

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.440
is Art.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.000
I heard

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.040
I heard

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.000
he's been at it

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.440
until his eyes nearly popped.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.640
But this one

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.640
is also a concern.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.120
Are your eyes still okay?

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:24.720
Hey.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.640
What do I have to do

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.880
to make you go home and rest?

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.360
Anything more interesting than work?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.280
Fine.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.120
I’ll give in.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.080
Give me

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.120
15 minutes.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.080
Deal?

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.960
Deal.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.240
I can wait longer if I have to.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.120
Excuse me.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.880
Ow,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.520
That hurts!

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.960
Really?

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.720
No, I’m fine.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.480
Feels good.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:20.840
Hill,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:22.920
you're good.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.640
I am.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.200
My mom used to

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.720
always make me give her massages.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160
I see.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.120
I

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.400
really love Thai massage.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.400
But

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.920
I'm too busy.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.280
No worries.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.680
From now on,

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.880
I’ll do it for you.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.800
Guess I’ll appoint myself

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.600
as Junji’s personal masseur.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.080
But you still

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.640
need proper rest.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.960
I know

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.800
that lately

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.000
you haven’t been sleeping well.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.320
you haven’t been sleeping well.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.880
And

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.560
you're skipping meals.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.080
I just get caught up in work.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.280
That’s not good.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.760
You’ll get sick.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.560
I really need

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.480
to take better care of you.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.480
Thanks.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.960
I’ll be counting on you.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.360
Just leave your

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.680
well-being to me.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.200
As for company work,

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.000
Junji,

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.400
Ganbatte ne!

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.760
Having someone cheering me on

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.440
feels

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.400
really good.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.480
Hey.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.440
You’re done?

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.280
Yeah, I’m tired.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.760
- Tired?
- Yup.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.480
I don’t know how to tell Phat.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.680
- Just tell him later.
- Mom.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.240
I brought mangosteen too.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.040
Bay!

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.760
Surprised to see you here.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.040
I…

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.200
What’s wrong?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.360
Nothing.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:52.720
Hey.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.360
Were you crying?

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.320
No.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.000
It’s my allergies.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.000
You're home so early today.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.200
You're home so early today.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.000
Don’t change the subject.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.840
Bay.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.840
What's going on?

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.680
Why is she crying?

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120
Uh…

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.880
It’s nothing. Just random stuff.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.640
I was telling him about the drama.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.240
The one I told you about.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.160
I got a little emotional.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.600
Yesterday’s episode,

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.720
the guy who loved the heroine got shot.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.040
Right?

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.640
Right?

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.920
Oh!

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760
Oh, that’s right.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.600
That was so touching.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.000
I nearly cried myself.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.240
Mom.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.880
I’m not seven anymore.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.160
I know.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.080
He's been waiting for you.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.160
You rarely answered his calls.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.920
- Move.
- I—

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.120
Give it to me straight.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.600
Why was she crying?

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.800
What was that about?

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.320
Well,

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.440
it's as she said. A drama.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.040
And she got emotional.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.440
Which drama was it?

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.760
Can’t remember.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.800
Just that

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.000
Baifern was the lead.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.280
There’s something.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.560
I don’t like this.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.880
Phat.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.760
Calm down. It’s nothing.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.960
She keeps lying,

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.080
thinking I can't tell.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.960
Even if I can,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.720
I still believed she'd always hated men.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.480
Phat…

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.040
Your mom loves you so much.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.440
She just doesn’t know

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.640
how to talk about difficult things.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.000
I’m not that clueless, you know.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
I’m not that clueless, you know.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.080
Then trust me.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.480
What I see,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.880
and what she doesn’t say,

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.440
is that both of them love you so much.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.960
And I do too.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.080
I just got back.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.240
Let me shower first.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.040
No.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:26.640
I like it.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.960
You smell delicious.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:31.960
Idiot.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.360
Enough.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.520
Bay.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.560
Let me shower first.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.040
Nope.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.600
Where did 120,000 baht go?

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.440
Mom took it?

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.160
Where’s she going?

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.800
Follow that car, please.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.280
Bay.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.920
How did you get here?

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.240
I

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.960
drove after you.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.680
What’s wrong?

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:26.960
You sick?

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:28.800
No.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.240
I just—

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:31.680
Wait,

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.960
since when were you following me?

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.120
The restaurant.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.000
Why didn’t you just call?

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.680
I want to surprise you.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.960
Sorry.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.640
We’ll talk later.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.280
Did you go upstairs?

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.000
Is Mom unwell?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.320
Is Mom unwell?

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.480
Bay.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.640
How did you get here?

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.360
And where was he there?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.320
Is he not working today?

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.000
Everything’s suspicious.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.360
Bay and Mom must be hiding something.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.680
It’s got to do with the missing money.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.920
Feeling tired?

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.280
Come watch this drama with me.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.840
Is this the one that made you cry?

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.720
Yes.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.840
Oh.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.080
But the heroine isn’t Baifern.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.480
That’s another show.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.120
I didn't watch that one.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.800
Which drama was it?

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.960
Can’t remember.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.000
Just that

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.200
Baifern was the lead.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.760
But I watched that one.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:15.760
So…

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.640
How’s your health lately, Mom?

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.680
What?

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.960
That’s so random.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.080
Is something wrong?

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.200
She seems fine.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.960
About

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.040
your new boyfriend,

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.120
how is he?

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.720
Bring him over sometime.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.680
I’d like to meet him.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.040
Maybe later. He’s busy.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.520
- Let's watch.
- Look at them.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.400
- I ship them together.
- Them?

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.680
Thank you.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.000
With your help,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.880
things are way easier.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.400
It’s my pleasure.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.080
If there’s anything else, just tell me.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.520
Bay.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.240
Pim.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.880
What is going on?

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.400
Phat.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.800
Mom.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.480
Phat.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.000
I’m sorry.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.120
I’m sorry.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.000
I didn’t mean to hide this.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.400
Who is that man?

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.160
Your dad.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.320
He’s your father.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.360
Phat, don’t—

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.680
Phat.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.200
Phat!

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.960
Please, let me explain.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.800
Why does it have to be you?

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.320
And why am I the last one to know?

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.000
That man earlier is my father, isn't he?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.640
That man earlier is my father, isn't he?

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.920
She wanted my advice
on how to break it to you.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.480
She couldn't say it.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.320
Is Dad’s condition really that bad?

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.640
Then I want the best doctor for him.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.960
Thank you.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.000
Oh, Bay.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.960
Bay, sweetie.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.520
Oh, hello.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.120
Hi.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.200
Hi.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.240
What are you two doing here?

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.280
So she lied.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160
Again?

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.160
She really had no choice, Phat.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.280
The man she once loved

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.840
came back for help.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.840
He’s dying, you know.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.480
Once loved?

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.760
Didn’t she say she hated him?

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.280
What’s his name?

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.720
She has never even told me.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.160
Because love hurts.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.000
You know her so well

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.040
You know her so well

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.240
in just a few months.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.840
Things like this don’t take long.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.840
And what about

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.760
when you said there'll be no secrets?

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.560
You said there'll be no lies.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.640
But in the end,

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.840
you’re all the same.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.000
I was going to tell you.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.000
I'm waiting a day or two,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.960
so your mom could tell you herself.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.640
Everything we did

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.360
was because we care about you.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.200
Don’t.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.320
I should never have trusted a man like you.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.360
And what about a man like me?

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.080
I was fine on my own.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.480
And what about a man like me, Phat?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.240
I don’t want to love deeply

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.000
and end up hurt like my mom.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.360
You’d better leave.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.880
The number you have dialed

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.120
cannot be connected at this time.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.600
Please leave a message…

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.760
Ms. Secretary.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.320
- Yes, dear?
- Is…

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.480
Is Bay on leave today?

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.040
Right…

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.640
I don't know.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.400
He didn’t say anything.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.320
Minus hundred in work ethic.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.160
Character data: Dylon.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:03.960
Wow!

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.400
He already finished everything.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.640
That's crazy.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.920
Dylon.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.760
A young man devoted to becoming a chef.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.360
Uninterested in love.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.880
Cold.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.280
Hates liars.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:24.600
Oh.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.160
Look,

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.160
Bay just sent his leave request.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.880
Really?

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.800
For how long?

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.440
Let's see…

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.600
He didn’t say.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.360
Company policy allows up to 10 days.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.840
Oh, I get it now.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.680
I think

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.880
He must’ve rushed to finish his work

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.040
so he could go on a trip with Mr. Phat.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.200
That sneaky guy.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.200
Mr. Phat?

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.120
Yeah.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.400
Oh dear.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.280
You didn’t know?

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.040
His instagram is full of Mr. Phat.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.000
Really?

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.320
Really?

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.640
I didn’t notice.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.080
Oh, it’s there.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.080
I’ll show you.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.760
Here.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.080
You can’t see his face,

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.440
but the arms, the hands, the back…

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.480
Jeez!

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.680
Why did he do that?

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.240
Anyone can tell it’s Mr. Phat.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.600
Just make it official.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.920
Well, except for you.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.120
I guess so.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.240
But

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.440
I guess it's not that surprising.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.040
You’ve been all over Boss lately.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.640
Everything else just flew past your radar.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.640
That’s not true.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.960
Then just make it official.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.000
His fans are rooting for you.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.760
Why not today?

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.560
Later, dear.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.000
Based on the character input from everyone,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.560
Based on the character input from everyone,

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.760
I came up with these designs.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.160
Mike has a cool, handsome look,

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.480
while Dylon’s warm and playful.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.600
Their facial features;

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.640
brows, eyes, nose, lips,

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.200
can express up to 480 patterns of emotion.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.640
As for outfits,

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.600
I got references from runway shows

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.600
and we'll keep updating them

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.760
to give players variety and fun.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.880
Hope you all like it.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.120
And now, Game Designers

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.400
and Level Designers have

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.760
worked together designing

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.440
every scenario,

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.360
every episode,

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.360
every scene,

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.480
and every mission.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.920
Guaranteed to be

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.760
extra

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.520
swoon-worthy,

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.440
ship-worthy,

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.280
thrilling,

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.080
flirty,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.800
juicy,

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.280
spicy,

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:43.960
and steamy.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.600
Right, Boss?

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.480
Come on, clap.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.000
Clap after the presentation.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.600
[applause]

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.800
Not sure what all that meant.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.480
What?

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.560
But from what I see,

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.320
it looks great.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.040
Please don’t mind me, Boss.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.240
Bay usually presents for us.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.880
This is not my strength.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.400
So… Art?

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.160
I test the system every 30 minutes.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.120
There were a lot of bugs.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.000
But I'm sure I fixed them all.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.920
Nothing escapes my eyes.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.600
Right now,

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.200
our programmer team is solid.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.880
And on the marketing side,

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.760
we plan to introduce Mike first.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.720
So people can get familiar.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.040
Then we’ll roll out campaigns.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.720
Even with just a silhouette teaser,

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.200
we’re already getting
great engagement online.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.480
So when we reveal Mike and Dylon for real,

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.960
it’s gonna blow up, Boss.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.360
Excellent.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.840
I see everyone’s dedication

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.040
in this project.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:00.840
Thank you.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.920
We’re ready to launch this game.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.960
While we wait for Japan’s confirmation.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.840
Bay’s already on vacation.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.120
So I’ll give everyone

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.120
next week off

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.800
as a special holiday.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.840
Thank you, Boss!

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.880
[applause]

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.360
- Pao.
- Hey!

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:29.880
Pao, man.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.720
Dude, give me a hand.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.200
Ow, my back.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.760
Bent over too long.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.600
Your face is red.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.520
Ow.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:40.840
Awesome.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.560
Who’s that?

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.120
- Oh, he's here!
- Dad, Mom!

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.320
Hello.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.160
Oh, hi.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.480
Hello.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.920
This is…

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.880
my boss,

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.080
Junji.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:25.960
He’s Japanese.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.680
Your boss is Japanese?

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.040
So,

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.760
can you speak Thai?

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.680
Yes, I can.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.960
Wow, that's good.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.400
Junji, this is my dad.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.120
He used to install and fix computers.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.000
I see.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.040
That’s why you like computers.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.840
You take after your dad.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.040
But he’s retired now.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:53.560
Hill.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.480
Not that.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.280
I retired early, got it?

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.360
Of course.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.000
More like error.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.720
More like error.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.800
He retired early because of his health.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.840
Honestly, he shouldn’t have.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.480
He should've kept working.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.240
Now he just annoys me every day.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.440
Worse than my students.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.920
Already bickering.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.160
My mom.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.760
She's an English teacher.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.240
Oh.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.480
At a local high school.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.640
Oh.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.640
Hello, Teacher.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.640
Hello.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.480
It must’ve been a long drive.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.680
Hill, take your boss upstairs first.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:29.920
- Sure.
- Oh.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.880
Hope you don't mind

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.720
the house being small and a bit messy.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.080
You should've taken him to a nice hotel.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.160
That's fine.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.560
I wanted to see Hill’s home myself.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.320
Now I’m embarrassed.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.960
But still,

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.520
you should’ve told me first, Hill.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.200
I could’ve made the house nicer.

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.200
Hey.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.600
I think

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.200
it already looks better than usual.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.000
Then,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.600
Then,

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.600
Junji can stay in Hill’s room.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.360
And Hill can sleep with us.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.800
Mom.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.880
No way.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.320
Dad tosses and snores.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.640
I wouldn't get any sleep.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:13.800
Then,

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.560
sleep on the living room sofa.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.320
Come on.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.760
No, Mom.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.880
I’ll stay with Junji.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.280
Are you sure?

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.720
Hill, I need to finish some work.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.040
Got some feedback I need to report.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.480
Right now?

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:35.760
Yeah.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.280
I see.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:39.560
Let's go.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:39.960
Come on.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.080
We’ll talk later.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:41.600
Go.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:42.960
Wait, Hill!

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.240
- It's work, Mom.
- Hey, Hill!

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.280
This way.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.640
Is that okay?

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.600
Here, take this.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.960
Use the inhaler before you faint.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.400
Take it.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.160
Always annoying.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.400
What kind of boss is that?

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.160
Even on vacation,

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.800
he’s making his employee work.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:10.840
Unbelievable.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.040
Dear.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.640
Are you playing dumb or just clueless?

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.600
Can’t you tell?

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.160
What?

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:19.880
Hey!

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.280
Two guys,

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.400
a boss and his staff,

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.040
close enough to visit his home?

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.720
If you ask me…

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.920
Hill must be really good.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.200
His boss must like him.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.520
And he's definitely
getting a big bonus this year.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.960
[laughs]

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.800
Yeah, sounds about right.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.080
- Come on.
- Let's go, dear.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.080
- I'm excited for him.
- Stop sniffing.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.480
Come on.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.360
- Come on, Junji
- Okay.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.720
Step here. Careful.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.800
Here?

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.000
Got it.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.640
Got it.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.680
Okay.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.360
Hold tight.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:19.960
Like this?

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:23.880
Jars.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:24.720
Yeah, jars.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.600
Jars.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.840
- Carve it yourself.
- Really?

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.640
Yeah.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.400
I’ll show you today.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.480
How to make—

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:35.640
Make this?

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.280
Yeah, we will.

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:37.600
For cats.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.040
A cat condo.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.720
It's not.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.200
Meow.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:41.640
Meow.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.920
This won’t shatter if you drop it.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.400
No way.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.880
If you drop it, it's fine.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.920
- Really.
- Can I?

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.360
Sure.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.440
Really?

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.520
- Really.
- You sure?

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.360
Can I trust you?

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.240
Junji.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.600
Seen a photo of him as a kid?

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.880
When he was chubby.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.040
He was huge.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:52.520
Wait here.

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.280
Dad.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.480
Right here.

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.320
Dear.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.560
Stop bullying him.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.640
You know he doesn’t like it.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.000
How is it bullying?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.200
I was fat too.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.960
He just inherited it from me.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:16.800
So?

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.880
He’s not fat now.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.520
Look at him.

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.080
Handsome

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.000
and smart.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.160
Learn to praise your son, dear.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.320
Or I’ll smack you.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.240
But honestly,

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.160
the reason I lost this much weight

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.960
is because of

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.880
Yuka-chan.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:35.920
Huh?

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.200
Yuka-chan.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.000
That’s still around?

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.800
More than around, Mom.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.120
- Jun—
- Our company…

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.000
…created "Yuka! Love Me Please."

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.840
I see.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.840
I’ll be honest.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.960
I always worry

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.680
that you’d end up without real friends.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.520
So I have to thank Junji.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.000
For being both a friend
and a good boss to you.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.960
For being both a friend
and a good boss to you.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:07.560
But,

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:10.920
Mom.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:12.680
Dad.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:18.400
Actually,

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:23.480
Junji and I are—

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.240
Oh.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.440
We know.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.400
You know?

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.440
We’re not clueless country bumpkins.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.200
Then,

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.240
what do you…?

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.520
Of course.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.240
It's fine.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.560
Who you date,

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.880
who you love,

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.120
that’s for you to choose.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:54.760
It's been yours

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.120
since the day we cut the umbilical cord.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Our job is just to care for you,

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.240
Our job is just to care for you,

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.640
and love you.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.120
As for the rest,

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.680
whichever path you take

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.200
is up to you.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.200
All I want is for you to be happy,

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.840
to have a good job,

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.880
to take care of yourself,

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.280
and to have good friends.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.760
That’s enough for me.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.160
Really, Mom?

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:21.960
Yeah.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.480
Thanks, Mom.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.240
Thanks, Dad.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:50.600
Speaking of friends,

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.120
that reminds me…

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.240
You got a letter.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.080
From your class president, Praewa.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.360
But I already opened it.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.360
Looks like an invitation to the reunion.

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.280
It's…

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.960
tomorrow, I think.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.600
Today.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.040
Huh?

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.280
Today?

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:11.680
Yeah.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.040
Oh no,

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:13.960
I got it wrong.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.200
But,

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.400
it's not too late.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.000
Just go.

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.760
Go on, son.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:20.880
No, Dad.

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.920
I don’t have close friends.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.320
No one would want to see me.

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.040
Is this Hill's phone?

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.120
I want to go.

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.520
I want to see

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.440
what a Thai reunion is like.

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.120
Let’s take a photo!

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.480
Junji, we should go back.

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.200
Hold on.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.720
We just got here.

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.000
The party looks fun.

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:16.680
But I don’t have close friends.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.360
Hill.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.640
You met Yuka in high school, right?

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.640
Think of this

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.520
as a memorial for you and Yuka.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.440
Cheers.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.240
That's…

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:38.760
Hey,

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.640
isn't that

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.800
Mr. Junji?

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600
That's him.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.160
Hey!

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.760
Mr. Junji, right?

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.640
But…

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.160
What brings you here?

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.000
Ah.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.600
Ah.

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.960
Praewa.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.880
Please tell me.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.240
How do you see me?

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.000
Who am I? How did I start

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.480
playing the game?

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.880
If you do

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.720
what I ask,

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.480
then I will

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.000
agree to be your girlfriend.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.960
Crawl around the room

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.040
and oink like a pig.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.200
I just want to know

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.440
whether or not you can grant me

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.840
a simple request.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.080
If you can't,

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.480
I don't think being my boyfriend

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.480
would be possible.

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.560
It’s me, Hill.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.160
Huh?

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.720
Hill?

00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.280
Oh my gosh!

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:55.720
Whoa.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.280
Man, you’ve changed a lot.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:00.000
I haven’t seen you in years.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.280
I haven’t seen you in years.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.720
I thought

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.280
you’d forgotten about us.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.560
So…

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.360
Mr. Junji, is he your friend?

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:17.440
Can I get a selfie with you?

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.080
I’m not his friend.

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.040
I'm his boyfriend.

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:27.640
What?!

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.760
Now I remember.

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:37.760
Praewa, you bullied Hill when he was fat.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.280
I’ve been wanting to thank you.

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.440
Because of you, he became so handsome.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.240
Junji.

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.960
That stuff, I—

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.000
Didn’t you say she was really pretty?

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.680
She’s just…

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.360
average.

00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.960
I never said that.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.480
I’m hungry.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.160
Let’s go eat.

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:05.560
Come on.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.280
Junji, we just ate at home.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.320
Mr. Junji…

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.760
and Hill?

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.560
That Piggy Hill?!

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.040
Yeah, calm down.

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.280
How is that possible?

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.960
And what, I’m not pretty?

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.320
You’re the prettiest, trust me.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.640
Excuse me.

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.040
Excuse me.

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.160
So…

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.560
How did you know about Praewa?

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.120
Oh…

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.000
I…

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
I asked Yuka

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.720
back when we first met.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:06.840
Actually,

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.800
it’s part of my past I want to forget.

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.680
But

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.760
I already forgave her.

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.800
She was just a kid back then.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.440
But now,

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.760
she’s grown up.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.800
She must be nicer now.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.000
Hill.

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.480
I really admire you.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.640
Because I lost weight?

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.880
For everything you are.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.320
You're optimistic,

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.080
kind,

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.320
and caring.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.600
All of that

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.600
is because of Yuka.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.320
Without her,

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.960
this version of me wouldn’t exist.

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.960
But really,

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.200
I should be thanking you instead.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:20.960
Junji.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.640
Forget the past.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.600
Let’s make new memories together.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.800
And this is "Eternal Kizuna."

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.800
Congratulations.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.440
The game we poured our hearts into

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.160
has succeeded beyond our expectations.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.440
You’re just waiting for him to come back?

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.600
But

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.160
isn't he also waiting for you?

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.160
I’ll create a new character named Haruki.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.520
Modeled after me.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.480
He’ll stay by Yuka’s side forever.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.240
The headquarters in Japan

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.360
asked me to return for a big project there.
