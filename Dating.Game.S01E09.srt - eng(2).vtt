WEBVTT

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.040
I want everyone to scout for

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.480
the spot for the game’s ending scene.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.960
I’m completely certain

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.200
about how I feel for you. It’s real.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.640
I can’t hold myself back anymore.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.920
The sponsored game scene
in your style, how's it going?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.720
…and speak heart-to-heart.
Just the two of us on the beach.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.040
Junji-san,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.920
I love you.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.080
…high tide in Japanese?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.120
High tide

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.280
High tide, low tide.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.720
I forgot Japanese.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.040
Let’s sit down.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.920
Are you going to give me an answer?

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.880
What?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.320
An answer?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.360
Wait.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.320
Why are you calling me "Junji-san"?

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.560
I'm sorry,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.600
Boss.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.800
Call me

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.520
"Junji."

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.800
Junji-sa—

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.080
Junji.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240
Jun… ji.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.960
Feels weird.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.200
Heh.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.400
Junji.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.000
Junji-san.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.840
Both are okay.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.680
Okay.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.200
So, Junji or Junji-san,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720
what's your answer?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.000
What?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.720
What?

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.960
Come on,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.720
don’t play dumb.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.120
Play dumb?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.920
What's that?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.720
Dumb, dump, dummy?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.520
Play dummy?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.480
If you keep playing dumb,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.480
I might have to remind you.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.760
Ready?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.480
Junji-san,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.120
I love you.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.640
Hill…

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.200
Are you telling me

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.960
or

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.000
Yuka?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.440
So?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.000
What's your answer,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.040
Junji-san?

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.120
Yeah,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.880
Me too.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.280
As in…?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.720
I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.840
love you too.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.120
Alright.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.040
I’m the happiest man alive.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.200
Banzai! (Yay!)

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.080
Hill, not so loud.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.720
It’s late.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.520
Okay, okay.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.720
Banzai!

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.720
Hill, I said quiet. It’s late.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.000
Banzai!

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.120
Art.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.840
Say cheese.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.800
Cheese.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.200
Nice.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.920
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.080
Junji.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.120
Yeah?

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.400
Have a look.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.000
Ta-da!

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.720
Ta-da!

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.400
Wow.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.520
Told you, players would love
the female version of you.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.880
You're quite bold choosing me
as the reference material.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.080
Because I like the Junji who's kind to me.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.720
Look at this.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.920
See that?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.920
The numbers are going up.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.600
Art.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.280
Yeah?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.600
Do you really mean it?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.880
Hold on, Junji.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.520
That’s not what I meant.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.920
I think you misunderstood me.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.880
Oh.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.920
Misunderstood?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.880
But…

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.520
all this time—

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.200
I…

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.440
I just saw us as colleagues
who worked well together.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.920
Nothing more.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.120
Art.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.800
I’m so confused.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.840
What’s even happening?

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.000
I can’t explain it.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.720
I just…

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.880
…felt it.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.920
I’m sorry.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.000
I don't swing that way.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.040
I don't swing that way.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.040
No way…

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.400
If I’d just accepted my feelings back then,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.960
maybe things…

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.040
Now, I know that my heart

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.000
is with you.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.120
is with you.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.720
So…

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.520
please forgive me.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.320
This isn’t just presenting a project.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.720
This is like a surprise proposal to Boss!

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:18.920
Yep.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.560
Damn.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.320
He went all out.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.720
Dude.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.000
Where are you going?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.120
Hill!

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.840
Jeez.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.520
What's up with him?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.000
I’m not mad at you.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.400
So there’s nothing to forgive.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.800
So you’re giving me another chance?

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.280
It's all in the past.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480
My…

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.840
…feelings have changed.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.000
I’m sorry.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.280
I’m sorry.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.240
Hang on.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.800
If that's true, why did you
bring me back to this project?

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.120
It's work…

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680
That's it.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.920
Nothing more.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.320
Boss.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.720
You’re cruel, Junji.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.080
This thing between us
is not ending that easily.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.120
You'll get fined, see?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.600
You cleared the minibar out.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.840
The company'll pay.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.640
You're roommates?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.760
No.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.720
- We're not.
- I saw how much she ate.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.920
Did you eat everything? You'll get fined.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.240
Boss looks happy.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.040
Everyone here?

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.120
Yes, Boss.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.840
Okay.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.920
Safe travels, everyone.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.080
Hill and I will stay a couple more days.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.440
Oh, Just the two of you?

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.720
Yeah.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.840
There’s a place I want to survey.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.680
Hill can help me gather data.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.600
I can stay as well, Boss.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.800
No need.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.320
Art.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.440
By the time I return,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.480
it’ll be a while before we meet again.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.520
So, thank you for helping us.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.880
I guess I’m useless to you now.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.800
Just kidding.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.280
We’ll see each other again soon.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.720
You know where to find me.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.600
Hill.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.640
Make yourself useful.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.120
Junji-san, do you think Art is mad at us?

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.680
No.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.680
He’s…

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.080
…always like that.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.040
[sighs]

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.720
I like it here.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.720
Hm?

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.280
Here?

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.880
Yeah.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.200
Why? Thailand’s so hot.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.760
Because…

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.960
I'm here with you, Hill.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:10.800
From now on, just call me Junji.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.720
Junji.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.840
Like a Thai nickname.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840
No “Mr.”

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.000
No “-san.”

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.760
Because we’re…

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.120
a couple now.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.640
Okay.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.320
Junji.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.920
My boyfriend.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.360
Finally, we’re here.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.520
You really want me to
drop you off at the restaurant?

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.040
I can drop you off at home.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.320
It’s fine.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.040
I've been gone for days.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.920
I have to do this.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.880
Alright then.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.520
I’ll stay with you.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.320
No need. Just go home.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.120
You’ve been driving all day.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.520
Why?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.640
I’m hungry.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.760
Can I have a meal first?

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200
Okay, fine.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.840
You better go home afterwards.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.480
Don't wait.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.640
I'll wait.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.080
Because I don’t want the person I love

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.800
to go home all alone and tired.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.320
Bay.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:55.800
Hm?

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.320
As for our relationship,

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.120
it’s better not to jump the gun.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.120
Why not?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.360
I’m not ready to answer
everyone’s questions.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.960
Besides, we only started dating yesterday.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.520
That's true.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.520
But I like you so much.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.920
I want people to know you're taken,

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.280
so no one will try to hit on you.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.680
What's the matter?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.600
If you’re good enough,

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.600
I’ve no reason to look at anyone else.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.440
Right.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.200
Do you understand me?

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.080
Of course.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.680
I'll do whatever I can

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.120
to make you feel at ease.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.720
Now hurry up, eat, and go home.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.200
And this is Yuka’s latest concept design.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.120
Ta-da!

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:23.880
Wow.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.600
That’s so cute. I love it.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.760
But what is this outfit for?

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280
Yuka's just like

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.440
any other girl who loves looking pretty.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.600
So if we give her a fresh new look,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.520
it might change

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.000
someone's mind about releasing an update.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.640
Nice.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.280
I like that idea.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.120
So, how was Chanthaburi?

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.080
Fun?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.360
Must’ve been fun or

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.960
you two wouldn’t have stayed on together.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.600
It was fun.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.160
We found some really great locations.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.520
Too bad you didn’t join us.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.960
It’s better I didn’t.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.160
Boss wouldn’t want me as the third wheel.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.120
Bet you were happier without me in the way.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.400
A-ha!

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.040
what’s with that look?

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.920
Spill it. What did you two get up to?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.000
That outfit's yours?

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.000
It's Yuka’s new outfit.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.320
It's Yuka’s new outfit.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.640
Yuka, huh.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.520
Hey, fans have never seen this look.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.280
Is this like a rebrand for Yuka?

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.200
But…

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.320
will Boss approve?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.720
Hm.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.080
Looks good.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.840
Really good.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.480
Boss.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.320
You feeling okay?

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.880
This is the first time

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.120
you’ve ever given an approval so quickly.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.120
Not scheming something, are you?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.880
What do you take me for?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.400
Hmph.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.000
Relax. Boss isn’t plotting anything.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.920
Relax. Boss isn’t plotting anything.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.720
He’s just in a really good mood lately.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.800
Want to pitch something? Now’s the time.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080
He'll say yes.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.800
May I?

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.560
When are we planning

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.120
to release Yuka’s new look?

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.320
Once it's released,

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.480
I'm sure fans will be surprised

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.000
and totally obsessed over it.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.240
And getting surprise updates

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.200
right before a game shuts down?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.120
They'll love it.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.520
If we drop this out of nowhere,

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.880
it’ll definitely go viral.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.080
Right…

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.920
Let’s make it a gift for the loyal players

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.400
who’ve always supported us.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.680
You got it.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.480
Hm…

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.520
But I think Yuka’s new look

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.880
should feel a bit more mature.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.480
- No.
- No.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.000
What? Is that such a bad idea?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.840
What? Is that such a bad idea?

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.640
Don’t reject it right away.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.800
We should at least discuss new ideas.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.840
Since Yuka’s game won’t be
around for much longer.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.360
And the new game for females is launching.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.680
Why not let the guys have more options?

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520
Too late for that.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.080
What’s going on here?

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.920
Got a problem?

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.200
The moment we dropped the new outfit,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.520
we started trending on X.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.280
No way it spread that fast!

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.240
That’s insane.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.720
Yikes.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.920
It's #banyukagame…

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:45.680
Whoa.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.480
It’s trending in Japan too.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.000
"Breaking news! The famous idol game

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.600
"Yuka! Love Me Please",

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.080
is exposed of its lie.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.320
Yuka, a male in disguise,
has deceived fans for years."

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.920
Who the hell wrote this?

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.000
Damn it.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.840
Damn it.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.040
"Pretending to be a cute girl,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.120
but actually a guy.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.040
Makes me sick."

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.320
What's done is done…

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.480
Here’s the thing.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.640
Yuka’s outer shell is based on Jeans.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.960
But inside, she is 100% Junji.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.400
You can’t tell anyone about this

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.600
because it’s top secret.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.240
Crap.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.640
We're getting roasted.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.600
Boss, you need to do something.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.200
Seriously,

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.720
who started spreading this nonsense?

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.920
People are reporting our game like crazy.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.080
Boss,

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.320
the number of users uninstalling

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.360
is skyrocketing.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.200
All because of that one rumor?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.640
That Yuka’s a guy?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.280
Who cares about that anymore?

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.120
Hearing it pisses me off.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.600
Isn't this about the heart?

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.000
I say we let gamers cool down a bit first

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.800
and explain later.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.120
Someone’s even threatening
to burn our office to the ground.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.880
Isn’t that too much?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.200
I don’t think they’ll actually do it.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.720
Just some keyboard warriors.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.120
Boss, Let's report this to the police.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.120
I’ll investigate

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.520
and find out who it is.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.440
This one got over 10,000 reposts.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.800
"Yuka's real identity

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.080
is Boss Junji,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.920
the famous CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand."

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.320
What the hell?

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.200
Boss is Yuka?

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.320
How could she be a cold guy like him?

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.600
…Enough.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.280
What they’re saying is true.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.640
I am

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.920
Yuka's reference material.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.680
I’m her blueprint.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.920
Boss? Yuka?

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.120
You are not alike.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.320
And how come I never knew?

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.440
At her core,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.000
she is modeled after him.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
she is modeled after him.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.120
He’s the feelings behind Yuka.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.720
Just like how he was also
the reference for Mike.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.000
That was Art’s idea.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.920
Mine too.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.880
Mine and Art's.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:21.920
Right.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.960
The idea was…

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.600
to make sure male players would

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.080
really like Yuka.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.720
So they thought, who better than a man

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.520
to figure out what men want?

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.680
What's their ideal girl like?

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.800
So Art suggested Boss

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.680
role-play as Yuka.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.600
I believe that Yuka became so successful

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.800
because we tried to shape her personality

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.120
and thoughts to be very realistic.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.000
We conducted interviews, did researches,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.280
We conducted interviews, did researches,

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.200
and gathered real women’s responses

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.080
to develop the character “Yuka.”

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.320
That’s why, to so many people,

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.920
Yuka isn’t just a game character.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.720
She feels truly alive.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.240
In other words, Boss became Yuka.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.920
Which was already a part of who he is.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.040
The problem was the game got promoted as

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.680
“Best Girlfriend: The Girl of Your Dreams.”

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.560
So Boss could never reveal the truth.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.400
It would’ve clashed with the marketing.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.200
So even the employees weren't

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.120
allowed to know?

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.160
Yeah.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.640
Especially those with loose lips like you.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.680
Ms. Jeans,

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.640
you knew

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.000
because you designed the character.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.520
because you designed the character.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.240
But I'm the game designer and

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.040
I wasn’t allowed to know?

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.280
Crazy, huh?

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.320
Totally.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.240
Crazy.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.840
But the whole thing’s blowing up.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.120
Which means,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.520
someone on the inside leaked it.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.720
But only a few knew: Boss,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.240
Jeans,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.200
and Art.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.200
That’s it.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.920
Art!

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440
Back then,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.920
we had no team, no budget.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.480
Yuka was just a character

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.320
that Art and I created from scratch.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.880
I never meant to deceive,

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.360
and neither did Art.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.240
Hill!

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.080
Where is he going?

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:25.880
Hill…

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.720
I never meant to lie.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.000
I already knew.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.480
That Junji is Yuka.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.120
To be honest,

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.600
I never thought it would get this far.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.120
Back then, I didn’t even

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.560
think of it as a lie.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.000
Yuka was just a character I created.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.920
Yuka was just a character I created.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320
Junji, do you know

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.760
why people love Yuka?

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:42.600
Because she’s cute and a talkative.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.000
Everyone loves her

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.360
because

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.000
a would never lie to us.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.480
a would never lie to us.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.920
No matter what happens,

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.480
she’d always stay by our side

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.520
and cheer us on.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.720
I’ve made everyone upset.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.320
But I don’t understand,

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.320
just because I’m a guy?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.680
Every dev team has both men

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.880
and women in it.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.920
It’s probably not anger, really.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.720
They’re just hurt.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:55.520
Because they told Yuka everything.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.000
Yet she never told them
the most important truth.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.760
Yet she never told them
the most important truth.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.640
It's disappointing.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.360
Hill…

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.880
do you feel the same way?

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.320
I like him.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.480
I'm happy when I’m with him.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.920
But

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.680
because I like him,

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.280
I feel guilty towards Yuka.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.880
No, not at all.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.720
When I found out,

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.120
I was actually glad.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.600
Oh.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.120
Why?

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.600
Hm.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.040
Well,

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.520
I felt like I was cheating as a gamer.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.120
I got to know Yuka’s real self.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.520
I’m sorry for being so difficult.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.160
And making everyone’s job harder.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.360
Your dream will definitely come true.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.200
I’ll help.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.640
[groans]

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080
Let's go, Boss.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.280
Hey!

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.280
Who are you?

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.920
I’m his bodyguard, obviously.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.680
Open it.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.160
I’ll make sure the water bottle

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.720
gets put to good use.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.120
Boss.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.920
Goodnight.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.080
And

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.800
when I realized

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.520
you are her,

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.400
everything made sense.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.520
You think so?

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.000
I think so.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.200
It all made sense because…

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.520
Junji and Yuka are the same person.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.720
That’s why I like you.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.120
I…

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.520
really can’t keep up with you.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.800
Hill,

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.800
you’re not mad at me, right?

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.280
No.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.680
I’m not.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.000
Then why didn’t you come
ask me when you found out?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.080
Then why didn’t you come
ask me when you found out?

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.640
Well,

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.440
that's

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.800
because all the pieces fit together.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.680
So I had no further doubts.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.680
And besides,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.040
I felt like it didn’t matter.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.120
If you wanted to tell me,

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.720
one day you would.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.240
At the right time.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.920
I was afraid…

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.600
that you’d hate me, Hill.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.280
Impossible.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.640
Never.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.680
You’re probably the only
one who doesn’t hate me.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.000
Yuka’s fans around the world

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.040
Yuka’s fans around the world

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.960
won’t feel the same.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.800
But thanks to you,

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.720
I understand the fans a little better.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.600
When die-hard fans of Yuka,

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.280
the cute heroine from
"Yuka! Love Me Please,"

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.560
found out that the real identity of Yuka

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.120
was Junji Sakurai,

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.240
CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand,

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.200
the company behind the game.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.920
They couldn’t accept it.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.520
Demanded the company take responsibility

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.000
for deceiving players all this time.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.480
for deceiving players all this time.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.120
Damn it.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.840
Store's rating dropped from 4.3 to 1.2.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.320
Check the comments.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.720
We’re getting grilled.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.800
Screenshot.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.920
Screenshot it all.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.320
If it goes too far, we sue.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.040
Calm down.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.120
That’s not the best way to handle it.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.400
Suing them won’t help.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.720
The agency just called.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.560
Sponsors want to pull out of the game.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.560
And the brand Boss is endorsing

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.440
want to renegotiate the contract.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.120
They even said it might be terminated.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.320
Damn you, Art.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.040
You told me not to sue people.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.400
Should I just tell Boss to sue only Art?

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:46.920
Mm.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.280
That could work.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.520
But we need proof

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.240
that Art leaked the info.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.880
But who else could it be?

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.720
What do you think, Hill?

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.640
I guess,

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.000
maybe we should try talking to Art first.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.360
maybe we should try talking to Art first.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.320
Unbelievable. I'm going insane.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.120
Guys, bad news.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.480
Our parent company wants
to hold a press conference.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.680
They want us to say that I'm the real Yuka.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Do you know how much
the company has invested?

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.880
Then,

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.400
have Junji-san hold a press conference

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.400
and officially announce that
Jeans-chan is Yuka’s real identity.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.480
Now we’re screwed.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.080
What?

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.600
Really?

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.240
Seriously?

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.720
We’re IT guys too, you know?

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.520
Tracing the first post

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.120
and its origin

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.880
isn’t that hard.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.600
That was quick.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.840
So you revealed this

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.120
to make Junji notice you?

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.120
I’m not a kid.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.120
Why would I do that?

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.560
You're right.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.680
Then why did you do it?

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.800
I just wanted the world to know.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.200
That’s all.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.320
How’s that working out?

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.480
Does ruining someone

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.120
make you feel better?

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.440
It’s alright.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.440
Doesn’t feel good, doesn’t feel bad.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.840
If you're feeling upset,

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.040
take it out on me.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.520
Why drag Junji into this?

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.040
You really don’t get it, do you?

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.720
Think you’re that important?

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.040
No.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.400
I’m not important at all.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.200
But you’re the one who created this game.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.120
And you chose this job

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.000
because you wanted players to be happy.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.760
because you wanted players to be happy.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.400
That’s what really matters.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.280
Fine.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.640
Why don’t you ask him directly

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.800
why he lied?

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.120
I already talked to him.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:21.920
He’s devastated.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.920
He wants to make things right.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.520
So he sent you here to talk to me?

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:29.640
Heh.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.640
Are you nuts?

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.120
No. I came here on my own.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.040
Really?

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.080
For what?

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.840
Just to lecture me?

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.720
Leave. You’re wasting my time.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.600
I came here to ask for your help.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.120
Not for Junji.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.720
For Yuka’s fans.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.200
I’m begging you.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.320
Help protect their feelings.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.880
People who have nothing to do with this

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.520
shouldn’t have to get hurt, right?

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.000
Are you…

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.880
asking me to help you lie?

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.320
Not interested.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.040
No. I’m not asking you to lie.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.440
And I’m not asking you to do it for free.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.520
I'm asking you to

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.440
show up at the press conference

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.800
and back us up, as the programmer,

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.720
that Jeans is Yuka's reference.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.840
Because it’s true, isn’t it?

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.000
The three of you made this game together.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.520
The three of you made this game together.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.880
You all shaped Yuka just as much.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.720
Go back to the part where

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.520
you said I’m not doing it for free.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.280
Well,

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.120
if you agree to help us this time,

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.480
I’ll talk to Junji.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.720
Tell him not to blame you for this.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.320
Using the fact that you're his boyfriend

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.600
to help with my case, huh?

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.760
Do you think Junji mixes personal life

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.920
with work?

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.320
Great.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.200
You don’t know him at all.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.640
But I do know that he is
more reasonable than that.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.120
Alright, then.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.920
If you want me to consider it,

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.120
you’ll have to do better.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.200
You have to leave Junji

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.080
and resign from this company.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.480
Can you do that?

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.720
Food will be served shortly.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.720
Table for one?

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.520
For two. A friend’s on the way.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.880
Of course, have a seat.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.720
Here’s the menu.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.520
Upload all those documents, alright?

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.080
Go ahead.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:29.840
Yeah.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.120
Exactly.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.200
That's right.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.280
Just do it.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.240
Here’s your menu.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.520
Thanks.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:49.920
Get it ready.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.680
I’ll be right back.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.600
Boss likes it that way.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.800
Doesn't matter if we use it or not.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.320
Yeah, print it all out too.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.000
If anyone asks for proof,
we can hit back with it.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:00.280
If anyone asks for proof,
we can hit back with it.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:00.840
Got it?

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.320
Good.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.720
Sounds like a mess.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.920
Got everyone crazy.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.440
Yeah. Big mess across the whole company.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.920
Your friend, my boss.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.120
Take a seat?

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.120
Later, a staff will

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.720
come take your order.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.360
Phat. Why are you in the kitchen?

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.320
Why not sit with your friend?

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.320
They ask for you.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.600
In a minute.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.280
They joined tables, you know?

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:48.840
Which table?

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.320
The new pretty lady,

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.440
the handsome guy, and your friend.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:02.920
They know each other?

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.760
I snooped a bit.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.600
Those two look like reporters.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.920
I’ll check it out.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.320
Mr. Bay,

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.920
could I get your LINE ID?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.880
I’d like to follow up on a some details.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.480
Of course, with pleasure.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.520
I'll do the scan.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.520
Okay.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:42.800
Here you go.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.600
Alright.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.240
You got it?

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.520
Feel free to call me if you need anything.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.720
Sure.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.800
All done with work talk?

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.000
Why not stay for dessert?

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.920
That's fine. We’re stuffed.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.000
Thank you so much.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.920
Alright. Thank you.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.520
See you.

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.280
I’ll text you later.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:06.720
Okay.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:08.880
Thanks again.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.360
You’re in the back

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.600
instead of eating with me.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.600
Can't help it.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.080
I’m the chef.

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.920
And I'm working.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:51.840
Hill.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.240
How did you get here?

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:54.640
I'm a genius.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:55.920
What?

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.560
Hill.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.480
Shoes off.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.920
I brought a bunch of food for you.

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.720
You haven’t eaten since morning, right?

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.560
Yeah, I really haven’t.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.000
Sorry for coming so late.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.480
Thought I'd be a bother,

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.520
but I figured you’d still be working.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.880
And I also thought…

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:46.200
that you shouldn’t be alone tonight.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.440
Thanks.

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.320
And I’ve got good news for you, too.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.680
What is it?

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.880
I talked to Art today.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.160
He agreed to show up

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.440
at the press conference.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.320
He’ll help confirm that

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.640
Jeans was the reference for Yuka.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.520
But if Art were the one behind this,

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.680
he wouldn’t agree to help.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.680
I already checked.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.680
It wasn’t him.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.160
It was the anti-fans

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.200
making things up.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.320
Here, Junji.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.000
Have you tried kaya bread from this place?

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.960
Have you tried kaya bread from this place?

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.880
I got it at the night market.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.720
Eat it while it’s hot.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.000
Try it,

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.800
it's extremely delicious.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.080
Hill.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.600
Are you alright?

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.120
I'm fine.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:23.880
You sure?

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.760
Just worried about you.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:39.240
I hate seeing you stuck
in a situation like this.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.320
Thanks for worrying.

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.440
But I’m the one who started it.

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.000
I put myself in this situation.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.480
So, I have to fix it.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.080
You are

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.440
the most capable person I’ve ever met.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.920
But even the strongest need to rest.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.920
I may not be able to do much,

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:21.000
but you can hand me some of the weight.

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.240
I’ll help carry it for you.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.000
Wait.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.080
Talk to me first.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.200
Not now.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.120
What are you afraid of?

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.400
Or do you just not trust me?

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.880
I’m not sure anymore.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.000
We’ve come this far.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.720
Tell me why you can’t trust me.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.240
We can do this.

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.720
We don’t have a single thing in common.

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.640
You’re right.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.920
We don’t have anything in common.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:00.000
But you complete me.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.480
Make me want to fit in with you.

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.400
And you know what?

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.920
You made me realize you're the one.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.520
No more running from the truth.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.000
My dad used to say that, too.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.320
What?

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.120
He promised he’d come back.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.600
But he never did.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.520
He chose the other woman.

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.680
I pitied my mom so much back then.

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.400
She used to say, “A cheater's the worst.”

00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.320
Even now,

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.720
I still can’t bring myself to tell her

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.240
that I’m dating you.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.920
I’m scared that one day
you'll stop feeling the thrill,

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.240
you'll get bored,

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.720
and you’ll be just like my dad.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.440
You’re my boyfriend now.

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.240
I swear to the heavens,

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.440
if I ever turn into that kind of man,

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.000
may I be alone forev—

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.120
Don’t swear it.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.680
Or I’ll end up alone too.

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.280
Let's go home.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:14.640
Better now?

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:31.320
[knocking]

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.240
Softer.

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.000
[knocking]

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.000
What's up?

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.120
Hello, Mom.

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:44.920
Hi, Pim.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:46.560
You again?

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.400
Perfect timing. I need a hand.

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.920
Come help me grab
something from the top shelf.

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.280
Of course, my pleasure.

00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:56.120
But first, I’ve got something

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.520
to tell the both of you.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.720
I’m…

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.800
dating Phat.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.240
Bay, don’t say it.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.240
It’s true.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.880
All right. I got it.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.000
Mom.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.080
I kind of figured it out
from the very first day.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.440
Come on.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:25.000
What do you mean?

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.240
It’s not what you think.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.000
Hey.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:27.720
Phat.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.680
You're all grown up now.
A boyfriend isn't a bad thing.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.080
I’ve got no problem with it.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:33.720
What?

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.280
Wait a second.

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.200
What’s with the plot twist?

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.280
You told me and him not to date!

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.600
[clears throat]

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.840
All men are jerks.

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.520
- I said that?
- Sure did.

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.400
I must've been drunk.

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.240
- Mom!
- Mom!

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.280
I mean, I was hurt.

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.800
Your dad was a real womanizer.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.760
Oh, Mom.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.240
You made me and Phat scared of dating.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.520
That’s why we’re still single.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.520
And he's got it worse than me.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.640
He’s practically afraid of love.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.520
Oh, dear.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.720
That’s not my intention.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.240
[sighs]

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.280
I'm getting a headache.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.280
Forgive me, will you?

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:28.640
Let’s just say, the old me is gone now.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.520
Actually,

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.080
I've got something
I want to tell you kids too.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.800
What now, Mom?

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.920
I’ve been seeing someone.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:51.880
Huh?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.680
Why didn’t you tell us?

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.720
Well, I was shy.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.000
I was afraid you’d think I'm too old

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.160
I was afraid you’d think I'm too old

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.720
to be dating.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.640
Is this even my real mom?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.040
Good love changes people for the better.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.920
And I want you two

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.680
to find good love as well.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.680
Wow…

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.960
since Mom’s saying it like that,

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.320
may I say something too?

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.320
Go on, I'm listening.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.320
Phat…

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.720
I promise you, in front of
your mom and your sister,

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.920
I’ll stay faithful and
keep no secrets from you.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.440
Marry him already!

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.720
Mom!

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.160
[sighs]

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.200
Bay, did you put a spell on my mom?

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.280
My charm's enough.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.080
Stop teasing him.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.840
Hill.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.520
You can go to sleep.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.320
I…

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.200
don't want to.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.520
I’ll wait until your work's done.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.240
It'll take a while.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.480
Still have to finish the speech.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.120
I can’t think of the right words to say.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.160
You know,

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.720
Yuka’s sincerity once saved me.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.000
And Junji, you’re the same.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.240
And Junji, you’re the same.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.280
Yuka or Junji.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.880
I believe if you just show your sincerity,

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.760
everyone will understand you.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.440
Okay.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:26.720
That’s it.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.600
Time to rest now, Junji.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.800
[sighs]

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.720
Hill, what do you think

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.480
Yuka would say tomorrow?

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.520
Tomorrow?

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.120
Hm.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.520
If it were Yuka,

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.080
she’d probably say

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.320
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.440
I think.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.520
At the press conference?

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.520
My Yuka-chan.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.280
No matter what life throws at her,

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.120
she manages to find the good.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.680
She’s someone who lifts people up.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.120
Taught me how to be more positive.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.360
Yuka-chan is very honest

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.480
but not rude.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.720
You get what I mean?

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.600
She never lies.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.400
Because…

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.880
Yuka was created to be the light

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.720
in the life of a lonely soul like me.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.520
Junji.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.440
I’m so proud of you.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.800
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.520
Thanks.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.040
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.000
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

01:05:59.000 --> 01:05:59.600
Yeah.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:00.840
Ganbaru. (I got this)

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.080
You said it wouldn’t be crowded.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.080
This isn't crowded.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.720
This is just the authorized press.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.520
Boss is really famous.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.880
Mr. Junji’s here!

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.320
Uh…

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.640
To avoid any mistakes,

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.520
I’ll speak in Japanese,

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.320
and Ms. Jeans will translate.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.040
I’m Junji Sakurai,

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:56.240
Executive and Director Game Designer
at PRISMSTAR Thailand.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.000
This is Mr. Art, our lead programmer,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.040
This is Mr. Art, our lead programmer,

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:05.240
and Mr. Bay, Mr. Art's predecessor.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.600
I’m Junji Sakurai,

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:11.520
Executive and Director Game Designer
at PRISMSTAR Thailand.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.800
This is Mr. Art, our lead programmer,

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.200
and Mr. Bay, standing in the back

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.760
was Mr. Art's predecessor.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.080
We created "Yuka! Love Me Please" together.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.440
We created "Yuka! Love Me Please" together.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.240
Both Ms. Jeans and Mr. Art

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.720
can confirm that

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.080
everything I’m about to say

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.520
is truthful in every sense.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.120
About the news that broke yesterday,

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.720
I am indeed the person behind Yuka.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.400
And yes, I deceived the players.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.000
Allow me to clarify.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.200
I withheld a crucial truth that

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.560
affected people’s decision
to buy and play the game.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.000
Some players grew so attached to Yuka

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.800
Some players grew so attached to Yuka

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.600
that they treated her
like a real girlfriend.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.960
When they found out through social media

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.800
that Yuka's modeled after a man,

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.160
they felt disappointed.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.200
I sincerely apologize.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.000
I am solely responsible.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:44.840
Now I understand why players feel so hurt.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.320
It’s because they believed Yuka embodied

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.480
sincerity, cheerfulness

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.840
courage and positivity.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.720
I never imagined that so
many people would trust me,

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.000
even though I was just
an invisible presence inside.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.320
even though I was just
an invisible presence inside.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.280
And I, Junji Sakurai,

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:13.680
apologize to everyone
for betraying that trust.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.680
But I can’t twist the facts.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.280
Yuka was modeled after me.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.040
That is the truth.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.400
It is true that Yuka was modeled after me.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.320
Is that true?

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.320
So it's really true?

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.120
Do you have no excuse at all?

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.800
Will you fix this?

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.200
Did you really do that?

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.080
It’s true, isn’t it?

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.800
Yes. I am Yuka.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.800
That's the truth

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:08.920
Oh dear.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.520
Man.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.880
Do you really have to go, Junji?

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.440
Bay.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.200
Pim.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.960
What is going on?

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.760
I should never have trusted you.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.280
You’d better leave.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.120
Dad, Mom!

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.960
my boss, Junji.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.000
You got a letter.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.120
Looks like an invitation to the reunion.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.360
Mr. Junji, right?

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.160
Praewa.
