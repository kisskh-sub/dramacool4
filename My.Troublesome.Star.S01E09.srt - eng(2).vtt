Are you crying?

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.370
You remind me of how you used to be.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.240
You're just like the dazzling Lim Se Ra from back then.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.080
Then why are you crying?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.910

Tell me. What looks strange?

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.770
No. That's not what I meant.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.010
You're beautiful.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.180
You're so beautiful.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.150
Oh, what a relief.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.960
What's that behind your back?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.060
What?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.360
Come on. You're hiding something this whole time.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.270
Are you hiding some snacks from me or something?

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.100
No, that's not it.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.470

Yes.

Go, Bong Chung Ja!

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.800
Ms. Lim Se Ra, could you share your thoughts on your comeback?

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.270
Yes, I've always dreamed of starring in one of Director Choi's films.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.640
And to be able to fulfil that dream after 25 years...

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.450
I still can't tell if I'm dreaming or if this is real.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.250
I will give it my all.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.520
Director Choi. This must be very meaningful for you as well.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.560
Did you have Ms. Lim Se Ra in mind for the role from the start?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.990
As you all know, this role was cast through an open audition,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.600
so that wasn't the case at all.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.000
But I can't deny I've long hoped to work with her.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.670
A question for Ms. Lim Se Ra. Could you describe your character?

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.779
We are also looking forward to your dynamic with Mr. Won Ban?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.380
How does it feel to be reunited?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.920
Could you say something to the fans who waited so long for your return?

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.560
First, I'd like to thank the fans who have waited so patiently.

- I think her dress ripped, right? - Are you okay?

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.620
- I'm so embarrassed. - Let's go.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.720
It's all because of Lim Se Ra!

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.370
You shot yourself in the foot. Who are you going to blame for that?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.540
Didn't you say Bong Chung Ja was going to make me shine?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.640
That you'd put me in the spotlight!

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.070
Hey. Don't get me wrong. I had no idea she'd look so amazing.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.140
She had zero support from the agency.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.179
She lost all that weight and got in killer shape by herself.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.110
What do you want me to do about her getting that gorgeous?

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.650
Why'd she get so gorgeous suddenly? Darn it.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.850
Lim Se Ra.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720

It's them. About that damaged item you got from the sponsor.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.190
What about it?

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.620
Do they want me to pay for it?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.960
Instead of making you pay, they want to switch models.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.600
- To Bong Chung Ja. - What?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.500
- Well... - Don't tell me you agreed to it.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.369
From the agency's perspective, instead of losing it to outsiders,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.340
it's better to pass it on to one of our own.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.440
Besides, you get many offers anyway. Bong Chung Ja only has this one.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.440
I want all my staff replaced.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.649
How is it the staff's fault that you're getting sidelined?

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.820
- Seriously? - Goodness.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.590
Come on. I can't fire them all now. There are contracts in place.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.690
Then at least fire the stylist.

Chavely or Novely. I don't care! Fire them all!

Is it my fault your dress ripped?

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.360
Do you really have to take it this far?

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.670
After all the years we've been through together...

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.680
We've been at this for two decades. I'd say I've been more than loyal.

You haven't seen trouble yet.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.669
And if it does? What could you possibly do?

About something that happened 25 years ago?

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.780
What can you possibly do without any proof?

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.580
Who says I don't have proof?

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.390
What do you mean by that?

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.160
That expression on your face is so convincing.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.760
You should've used that acting gift on screen.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:31.139
If you had, then Lim Se Ra, who just reappeared after 25 years,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.800
wouldn't be trouncing you like this.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.010
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.850
Are you sure you want me to talk about it all right here?

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.020
Have a good one, Hui Yeong.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.690
Why do they have to cause a scene in my salon?

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.330
Something must've really happened 25 years ago.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.300
She said she had proof.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.600
Gosh, you scared me.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.570
How long have you been there?

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.280
Ever since you started doing Go Hui Yeong's makeup.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.580
Really? Gosh, how did I not notice you?

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.209
Nobody noticed. And it's not like I'm easy to miss.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.550
Perfect. Then you must have heard everything.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.949
What did she say? What proof?

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.189
What is it? Tell me!

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.620
- Hold on a second. - Hurry!

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.230
- I don't know either. - How could you not know?

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.430
I dozed off.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.560
Are you kidding me? How could you sleep at that moment?

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.000
Wait a second.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.799
Then the accident from 25 years ago...

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.710
might not have been an accident at all.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.410
But Go Hui Yeong acted like she had no idea there was any proof.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.450
Oh, my. How come?

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.150
Was it incriminating evidence against Go Hui Yeong?

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.320
Don't tell me Go Hui Yeong did something to Se Ra...

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.430
I mean, she did hate her enough to want her dead.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.400
Oh, my gosh. This is crazy. No, it couldn't be.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.770
Actually, Go Hui Yeong would absolutely do something like that.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.840
Remember the talk of how she took Lim Se Ra's spot after her accident?

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.740
If only we knew what it was. Seriously, what could it be?

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.110
- Should I get it out from Chavely? - How?

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.719
You know me.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.680
Women used to fall for Gu Nam Ju with just a flicker of my finger.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.050
Chavely was head over heels for me back then, too.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.659
Gosh. What decade was that? Now, you're a shrivelled radish.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.530
Hey! I told you not to mention radishes!

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.700
Gosh. He can be so cute.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.370
So Chavely is the key to all this?

Gosh. It's not like I'm going into battle.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.649
Oh, honestly.

No, I'm the one who should be asking that of you.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.110
So were you able to get some sleep?

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.740
I was too nervous.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.010
For this scene, I'm not sure if I should hold back my emotions...

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.549

I'll do my best.

What's this? What was that for?

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.270
I'm finally giving it back to you.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.170
I should have done it a long time ago.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.740
I had to catch the culprit first.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.510
So I put it off on purpose.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.480
With that hanging around my neck,

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.190
I never had a single peaceful night's sleep.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.990
I'm so sorry.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.230
Cut! That was great!

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.860
It was?

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.440
Gosh. I didn't know she had that look in her.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.439
The focus was soft on Hui Yeong. Should we do another take?

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.780
No. It'd be hard to get that look again,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.310
- so let's just use this one. - What?

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.450
Me?

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.920
Director. Did I hold back too much? Is that okay?

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.390
Are you kidding? It was great. It couldn't have been more perfect.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.560
It was the best!

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.800
Where's my chair?

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.730
Hui Yeong! Here it is. Right here!

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.570
Gosh.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.480
Gosh. It's not summer, but it's so hot.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.880
Here.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.850
Drink this. I thought you'd be hot and got this.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.720
Did you run all the way out just for these?

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:51.559
Look how much you're sweating.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.190
- I'm fine, really. - It's cool, right?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.860
- Hey, I said I'm hot! - It's right here!

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.499
- Hey! - Gosh.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.539
Oh, Hui Yeong.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.340
What's wrong with your face? It's a total disaster.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:11.640
Let me just fix your hair.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.650
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.850
Today is just so much fun. It's just the best day ever.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.720
I'm sorry for not being there for you.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.930
For not being there for you.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.200
You've read that 100 times now. Have you still not memorized it?

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.800
Of course, I have it memorized.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.769
While Go Hui Yeong became Queen of Cannes,

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.470
I was out of the game for 25 years.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.170
If I want to even begin to catch up, I have to study until it's perfect.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.780
Gosh. Why does it get harder the more I look at it?

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.049
But from what I could tell,

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.980
the director seemed to like it a lot.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.720
As if. That was just a camera test. He was just being encouraging.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.790
Gosh. Still, you actors are amazing.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.690
How do you memorize all those lines? I couldn't do it for the life of me.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.330
Anyway, is there any way I can help?

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.900
Actually, there is one thing.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.270
What?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.250
"Whenever I saw your face through that crack in the window,"

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.780
"I felt like I was back in the only happy moment of my life."

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.420
"What is it? Are you going to hold my hand?"

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.430
"I'm sorry this is all I can do for you."

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.530
"No."

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.700
"You're already doing enough. You're here by my side."

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.200
"You haven't left me."

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.850
"I don't think I can go with you tomorrow."

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.619
"Let's say our goodbyes here."

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.220
"Then just promise me one thing."

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.130
"That you won't leave and you'll wait for me until I return."

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.900
"I promise."

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.569
"He moves closer."

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.570
Where to?

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.099
"He moves closer."

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.170
Where to?

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.470
Where to?

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:24.810
Where to?

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:25.810
Oh, seriously.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.010
Gosh. This is a lot harder than it looks.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.550
Goodness.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.819
I'm so bad at this. I'm no help at all.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.179
- Oh, never mind. - Gosh.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.490
You were great. The problem is you were too great.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.360
Really?

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.120
You really think I did a good job?

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.530
So it's true what they say. Right?

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.270
You know, when we do undercover work,

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.400
I've been told I'm a natural at this kind of thing.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.139
Am I a natural actor or what?

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.909
Okay, let's do it again. Ready.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.910
No, that's okay.

00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:01.550
We're good. That's more than enough.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:02.610
We're good.

00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:03.909
No, I've got it now. I can do better.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.220
Alright. "Then promise me one thing."

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.049
"That you won't leave and you'll wait for me until..."

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.220
Stop!

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.160
You're getting a call.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.390
Right.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:16.690
One second.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.260
Yes, Dokgo Cheol speaking.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.030
I praise him a little, and he really thinks he's a star.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.510
And what's with that look in his eyes?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.680
Okay. I'll head over right away.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.180
It sounds like you're busy. You should get going.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.450
No, it's okay. I can drop you off first.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.850
I'm going to stay and practice more, so you go on ahead.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.719
Oh, really? Then call me when you're leaving...

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.790
and when you get home. Promise me.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.760
I was just getting the hang of it.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.430
"So this is goodbye. Don't forget your promise."

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.630
Later then. I'll call you.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.200
"Through the crack in the window..."

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.680
Excuse me.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.150
I made myself clear, didn't I? Smile and be pleasant.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:49.890
You do so well in practice, so why do you seem so stiff outside?

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.320
I'll do better next time.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.990
There are tons of trainees desperate for this chance.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.030
Get it together.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.410
Excuse me. You left this in the restroom.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.380
- Thank you. - Do you want to grab a coffee?

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.520
I'm still pretty new to the company,

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.520
and I don't really know anyone yet.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.320
I was hoping we could be friends.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.060
- I have to get to practice soon. - I see.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.860
Well, maybe we can talk sometime later, then.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.599
You know, we can talk about things we can't say out loud at work.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.200
It's always nice to have someone to vent to.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.670
Riley.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.670
What is it?

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.110
I should get going.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.190
There are tons of trainees desperate for this chance.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.190
Do you really not know who made the movie investment?

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.730
I wasted the feast placed right before me.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.400
Pathetic, aren't I?

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.570
No. That feast would've made you sick.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.010
Forcing yourself wouldn't have been worth it.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.410
No matter what others say,

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.220
nothing beats a simple, comforting home-style meal.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.490
Don't you agree?

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.660
I wonder how he's doing.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.530
He must be so old by now.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.710
So he was fine when he fell asleep, then suddenly had a seizure?

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.919
Is the cell really so crowded that no one would notice a man die?

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.450
No, it's actually pretty spacious for the number of inmates.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.219
Now that I think about it, wasn't Kang Dae Gu...

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.089
the last one to be placed in that cell?

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.860
So the other guys in there must be close, then.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.760
- The guards don't track that. - Right.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.630
I guess I can just ask Kang Dae Gu myself.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:16.700
Has he regained consciousness?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.770
Oh, yes. Thankfully, he's out of the woods.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.470
The medical staff says he should be regaining consciousness soon,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.440
so please let his cellmates know. They must have been worried.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.550
- Yes. - Okay.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.850
- All right, then. - Take care.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:45.400
Goodness. Your batting average is awful.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.560
Right?

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:54.200
How do you manage to whiff it every single time?

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:02.250
Does that wench have several lives?

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.320
Or are we the ones with all the bad luck?

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.590
Are we in a race to the grave? Darn it!

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.599
While you have all your limbs, don't make your guys do it.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.300
You have to finish the job yourself. Okay?

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.929
(Bong Dumpling Shop)

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:55.200
He may be your father. But to me, he killed my father.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.870
Gosh, time is a scary thing. How has Lim Se Ra changed?

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.769
I saw her the other day, and she looked like she's had work done.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.839
That's what money gets you.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.209
- Procedures, surgery, you name it. - I heard she's totally broke.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.049
I heard she married into the yakuza. Maybe she got washed up and dumped?

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.120
Wasn't she a chaebol's trophy wife? She's back now the money is gone.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.190
Pathetic.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.630
Is Lim Se Ra a piece of fruit? What do you mean, "let herself go?"

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.300
- Has this old lady lost it? - Who are you calling an old lady?

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.170
I'm way younger than you. Has this old lady gone senile?

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.130
Hey, what part of me looks like an old lady?

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.069
Shut it and get out. All of you, get out!

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.970
Seriously, are you crazy?

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.239
(Welcome.)

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.580
(Come again.)

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.320
They don't know anything.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.470
Se Ra. I'm here.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.740
You haven't eaten?

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.110
Se Ra.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:18.550
Se Ra.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.700
Se Ra. Please eat something today. It's already summer.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.669
It's hot, isn't it? I'll put the fan here for you.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:44.270
They're saying it's the first snow. Dad's parole hearing is soon.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.179
I believe in you, Se Ra. You can get back on your feet.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.010
Everyone is waiting for you.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.220
Se Ra.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.990
My college entrance exam is next week.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.320
I really want to see you that day.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.140
You should have asked me to come. Give it to me.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.940
It's good exercise for me. I probably burned 50 calories.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.280
You must be tired, driving all the way to Busan.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.580
Don't worry. It's part of the job.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.319
I've got a neck pillow, drink, and snacks.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.479
I've got everything ready.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.880
So you can just relax on the way.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:28.950
All right, let's go.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:36.560
Gosh. How long has it been since I've been to Busan?

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.330
Twenty-five years?

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.070
Are you talking about that police station in Busan you mentioned?

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.800
The gukbap I had back then was amazing.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.610
Should we go have some when you're not filming?

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.720
- Is it still there? - I think so.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.580
I'd love that.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.720
I've actually always wanted to try the noodles at the place next door.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.490
I see.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.730
Why that noodle shop?

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.900
It's just one of those things.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400
I see.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.440
It's me. Yes.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.470
What?

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:25.940
What are you talking about?

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.450
What happened?

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.719
He apparently had a seizure. We've checked the CCTV footage.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.089
And besides the medical staff, no one went in or out.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.160
Really?

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:48.500
If they're willing to pull a stunt like this, they'll stop at nothing.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.670
From now on, this will be treated as the Kang Dae Gu murder case.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.700
What about the body?

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.170
I'll handle the National Forensic Service,

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.839
so investigate all the medical staff in Kang Dae Gu's room last night.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.880
Don't leave anyone out.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.360
(Busan Station)

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.500
I'm so sorry. Something urgent just came up.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.100
Don't worry. The train was fast and comfortable.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.170
This urgent matter is not something dangerous, is it?

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.840
It isn't. There's nothing to worry about.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.940
I'll handle it quickly and head right down.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.250
Don't worry about the shoot. Just focus on your investigation.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.180
Catching the culprit is what's important.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:41.150
I'll make it there today. Be careful until I arrive.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.550
Okay.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.420
Here's that file you asked for.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.259
I've compiled all the information on people...

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.530
around Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.170
It turns out Assemblyman Min Guk Hee is tied to an entertainment agency.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.399
("Assemblyman Min Guk Hee Caught in an Entertainment Gangster Scandal")

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.170
- Could it be an actress? - Nothing was officially reported.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.180
The management agency that brokered the deal was Lim Se Ra's.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:10.750
"Lim Se Ra?"

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.420
I met a horrible man today.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.260
Actually, there's a movie I wanted to be in.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.390
("The Sad Voice")

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:21.960
I scrapped it.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.530
(Kang Du Won, 46)

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.320
"I'm sorry this is all I can do for you."

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.120
"I'm sorry this is all..."

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.830
"I'm sorry this is all I can do for you."

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.800
What was that?

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.910
Is he here already?

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.350
You're...

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.060
Whenever I saw your face through that crack in the window,

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.700
I felt like I was back in the only happy moment of my life.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.970
What is it? Are you going to hold my hand?

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.610
I'm sorry this is all I can do for you.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.880
You're already doing enough.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:56.950
You're here by my side.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.090
You haven't left me.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.000
"You're already doing enough. You're here by my side."

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.160
"You never left."

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.370
Oh, I'm sorry. Where were we?

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.110
Oh, right here.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.680
Right here. It's from here.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.280
Right. Thank you.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.280
You must be tired, but you're still running lines.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.320
I'm the one who asked you.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.790
Should we go again?

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.860
Okay.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.700
High accident area ahead. Please drive safely.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.660
Excuse me. Mr. Manager.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.270
Do you want to get a drink with me?

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.040
We have an early shoot tomorrow. We should probably call it a night.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:02.680
You never know. A drink might loosen our tongues.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.220
It's just one drink.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.760
When I make a promise, I keep it.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.270
Come on. Just have one drink.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.180
Fine. If you insist, I'll have one.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.780
Gosh. What's this?

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.150
Gosh. This looks like the expensive stuff.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.380
Nice.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.820
I'll have one more.

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:45.460
Are you really just a manager?

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.989
I mean, what kind of a manager...

00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.030
would get on his knees for an actress?

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.470
You just don't strike me as the manager type.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.970
So what's the deal with you two?

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.170
Since you brought it up, let me ask you something.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.280
I heard CEO Kang Du Won used to be your manager.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.620
What's your relationship with him?

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.590
Where did that come from?

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.290
It's just that I saw you two before, and you seemed very close.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:28.759
Us? We're practically family.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.370
Inseparable.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:34.470
For people to get that close, something must have happened.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.170
Like surviving a brush with death together,

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.839
or sharing a deep trauma,

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.680
or maybe covering up a secret for the other.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:46.820
You're not wrong.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.649
We almost hit rock bottom together.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.890
We were both scarred by it.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:57.760
And we buried a secret together.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:35:59.730
What secret was that?

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.910
If I told you, it's not a secret.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.320
Come work for me.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.120
I'll double whatever Lim Se Ra is paying you.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.490
Is that the thing you couldn't say while you were sober? Is that all?

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.760
What do you mean, "Is that all?"

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.700
Financially and for your career, working with me is a better deal.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:42.170
After 10 years, you get a feel. After 20, you can see the future.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.710
I can tell just by the look in your eyes.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.080
You didn't become a manager just to be under someone, did you?

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.620
A man with no ambition...

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.990
is so unattractive.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.790
If I have ambition, that's why I work with Ms. Lim Se Ra.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.919
What?

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.430
I took this job in the first place because of Lim Se Ra,

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.000
so there's no reason for me to get involved with you.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.700
- If that's all, I'll be going. - No, wait!

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.739
You're not going to leave a drunk woman here all alone,

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.849
are you?

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.050
I'm drunk.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:25.750
So drunk.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.720
Gosh. I'm so drunk.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.289
- Get in, quick. - No, this...

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.560
Seriously, why did you drink so much if you had such low tolerance?

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.300
Use your legs. Stand up straight.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.630
Wait. Come on.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:44.300
I can't believe you drank this much.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.240
Hey! What floor? Hurry up and press it.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.940
Take a guess.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.680
Gosh. Seriously.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.790
It's not what it looks like. This is a misunderstanding.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.690
Wait.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.860
Wait.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.230
I was wondering why you were so late,

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:13.700
but now I see why.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.369
No, it's not what it looks like.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.829
Excuse me. Explain this, please.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.600
Seriously.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.169
- Wait. Excuse me. - Life is good

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.640
Let's get another glass of whiskey.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.980
- Whiskey. - "Whiskey?" Come on.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.480
Darn it.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.450
I'm going to lose my mind.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.200
Gosh.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.370
I've been set up, haven't I?

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.770
Seriously!

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.239
Driving drowsy is dangerous, so make sure you rest on the way.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.770
Is everything okay?

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.170
I'm getting worried, so please text me back.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.650
Do I answer her?

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.050
Wait.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:48.820
She was fooling around with Won Ban, too. I'm not doing it.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.869
Cut! Okay.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.040
- Are you okay? - Here you go.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.370
Oh, thanks.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.570
Here. Let's eat this together.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.810
Gosh.

00:40:08.811 --> 00:40:10.150
This one's for you. Here you go.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.850
I've never seen such beautiful lunchboxes.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:16.790
Gosh. I can't take the credit for this.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.050
It's all thanks to my amazing fans.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.989
- Hello. - Won Ban!

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.090
- We love you! - Thank you.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.060
You have such a way with words.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.030
You haven't changed a bit.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.170
Neither have you, Se Ra.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.100
You're exactly the same.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:40.510
As pretty and radiant as ever.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:45.820
Excuse me for a second.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.990
- What are you doing? - I'm not doing anything.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.860
- I just saw you take a picture. - No, I didn't.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.329
Come on. Give it to me.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.870
Hey. This is an invasion of my privacy.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.640
You're already violating privacy laws. Now let me see it.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.310
Who do you think you are, Mr. Loner? Are you a cop or something?

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.920
This is unbelievable. Do you think if you glare at me,

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.750
I'm going to get all scared and just hand it over?

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.460
A candid shot of Lonely Dokgo Cheol.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:34.860
He just got owned. This is hilarious!

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.069
Won Ban has already got his eye on her.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:40.400
It's game over.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.410
You think this is funny?

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.780
- Gosh. - You know they had a scandal.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.950
- "A scandal?" - Yes.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.320
People always say those scandals are fake.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.130
Come on. Where there's smoke, there's fire, right?

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.800
Even my scandals were true.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.470
Gosh. You're really something else.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.500
I heard Won Ban chose this project only because of Lim Se Ra.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.270
No way. Why would Won Ban do that?

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.879
Besides, that was ages ago. Why is this still a topic?

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.820
Come on. First loves are like wine. You just don't get it.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.690
- Her first love? - Yes.

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.559
That's why he's still single even though he is a top star.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.489
There has to be a reason.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.229
A first love she can never forget...

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:41.300
is seared deep into her heart. None other than Lim Se Ra.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:44.930
Are we in a drama?

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.700
"Seared deep into her heart?" As if.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.639
But I'm still your fan, Mr. Loner. I mean Mr. Dokgo.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.640
Keep up the good work!

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:20.240
The sea hasn't changed in 25 years.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.940
I told you, I'm not hungry. I had a huge lunch.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.010
I'm not surprised.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:29.480
That was no lunch. It was a hotel buffet.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.480
Gosh. You saw that?

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:36.150
You two were sitting so close, all chummy.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.920
It was kind of hard to miss.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.260
Goodness. When were we sitting so close?

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:47.060
And who was holding someone so tight last night?

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.830
That's right. You were.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.940
Wait. That was part of the investigation.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.900
Oh, my. Look, we're here.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.510
(Best Pork Gukbap)

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.850
How has this place not changed at all?

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.720
My gosh. Even the sign is the same.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.500
- Help yourselves. - Thank you.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.400
Thanks.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.369
She hasn't changed a bit.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.770
- It tastes the same, too. Try it. - Oh, right. The spicy paste.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.909
Stop. For pork gukbap, you start with the clear broth.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:37.750
Okay. Instead of the spicy paste...

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.220
The pork gukbap from Busan has the deepest broth.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.990
That's why you need to add only a bit of salted shrimps.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:49.320
Here. You have to season it with salted shrimp. Now, try it.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:52.630
There.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.640
Go on. Just try it. Trust me on this.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.310
Okay.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.150
Yes, this is it.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.650
Is it good?

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.030
- Hey. - Hey.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:28.060
- You go first. - No. Chung Ja. You go ahead.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.700
- About last night... - Wait.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.140
Let me explain last night first.

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.310
Okay? I was drinking with Go Hui Yeong.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:43.610
You were drinking with her?

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.189
Well, we didn't start drinking together.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:52.550
I just happened to join in halfway through...

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:56.529
That's unbelievable. I was waiting for you to come home.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:00.359
Wondering if something was wrong, I was up all night and got no rest.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.870
And during all that time, you were drinking with Go Hui Yeong?

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.869
- Gosh. - Let's be honest.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.709
You didn't lose sleep because of me. You were too busy chatting away...

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.740
with that Won Ban, or Won Pan, or whatever his name was.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.080
You think I don't know?

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.049
We were just practising lines.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.319
"Practising lines?" What a convenient excuse.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.349
Goodness.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.550
Then I'll just say I had a little 1-on-1 drinking session, too.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.119
Practising lines sober...

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.259
and clinging to someone drunk. Are those the same thing?

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.030
"Clinging?" What do you...

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.469
So should I have abandoned a drunk woman in the middle of the night?

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.429
You looked like you were enjoying it plenty...

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:39.599
when Go Hui Yeong was leaning all over you.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.999
Gosh.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.069
- Gosh. Now I suddenly need a drink. - "A drinking session?"

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.539
- Excuse me. Bring us some soju. - Okay.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.849
No. There's filming tomorrow. We can't drink.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.279
Please bring it anyway.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.519
Thank you.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.320
Seriously, we have a shoot tomorrow.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:59.990
You have a shoot. What is this...

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.120
The shoot isn't until this afternoon you know.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:14.699
Practising lines was just an excuse. You looked thrilled.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.640
So was I practising a kissing scene with him or something?

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:19.780
That's hot.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.250
- A kiss? - And what if it was?

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.250
That's not okay. Right?

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.750
A kiss? Without telling me, your manager?

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:45.770
Darn it.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.410
See? Look at that.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.410
I can down a whole bottle of soju and still walk a straight line.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.720
Sure.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.520
Go Hui Yeong's always been like that.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:10.430
You totally fell for her pathetic natural act, didn't you?

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:13.230
Fine. I was wrong. Are you happy now?

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.699
No, that's not it. I wasn't looking for empty words.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:23.370
That's not the kind of apology I wanted to hear at all.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.710
Look. I'm sincerely sorry.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:36.180
No. From now on, I won't drink with anyone other than you, Chung Ja.

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:38.090
How's that?

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:42.920
I mean, you don't have to go that far.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.060
- We're here. - Yes.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.600
Here.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.040
Bye.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:59.839
- Wait. Hey. - What?

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.040
This won't do.

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:07.820
Tonight, I'm sleeping here.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:48.060
Why insist on sleeping in my room? Our rooms are identical.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.440
I don't see anything here.

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.620
Goodness. I knew you'd be here.

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:08.239
I see we've already met.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.300
Right?

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.930
Hey. Why are you guys doing this?

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:51.950
Hey.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.780
Who sent you?

00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.850
It wouldn't do you any good to know.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:02.920
- He doesn't care about us. - You...

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.730
Darn it.

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:16.270
Stop, you punk!

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.420
Stop!

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:40.430
Darn it.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.450
Plate number 12CH-0484. Run a trace, fast.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.520
Hurry!

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.170
Okay. I just ran it.

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:19.570
You were right. It's a ghost car.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:21.670
Anyway, I'm on it,

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.070
so I'll call you as soon as I get something.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.610
Gosh. If I were on duty, I'd at least get overtime for this.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.709
Why am I out of bed for this?

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:33.549
(CCTV Monitoring Center)

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:34.650
What?

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.420
That punk.

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.509
- Why is there a thief in the hotel? - Did they catch the culprit?

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:07.449
- They crept in. How scary. - Whose room was it?

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:08.479
If it was in the main building, it couldn't be a staff member.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.749
- It could be an actor. - Wouldn't that be a bigger problem?

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.459
- Right. Was anything stolen? - What were the managers doing?

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.490
- Are you missing anything? - I don't know.

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.530
Tonight, I'm sleeping here.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:24.430
Why insist on sleeping in my room? Our rooms are identical.

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:35.280
Oh, sorry about that. I should've left earlier.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.610
- What happened? - Here.

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.150
- What do you mean? - Last night.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.290
- Let's talk on the way. - Sure.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.160
Here you go.

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:54.130
Hello. We're going the same way. Can I join?

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.160
Where's your manager?

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:58.769
I don't get enough gigs to need one.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:54:59.900
After their cut, I have nothing left.

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.840
Let's go. Let's get this show on the road.

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:04.940
Quick.

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:06.980
Hop in.

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:32.030
- You don't look so good. - I'm fine.

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:36.300
I just slept with the window open last night. I'm fine.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.169
I overheard the crew talking earlier,

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:42.540
and they said something happened at the hotel last night.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.910
Did something happen?

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.460
Are we close to the rest stop yet?

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.400
Just get some sleep.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:16.509
Yes. Go lay low for a while.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:20.119
According to recent polls on the upcoming Seoul mayoral election,

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.020
Candidate Min Guk Hee is the clear front-runner.

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:27.659
A former aide to Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan,

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.860
the party's former floor leader,

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.029
he inherited the assemblyman's seat and won three consecutive terms,

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:35.960
allowing Candidate Min Guk Hee to build a solid support base.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:39.500
From now on, this watch belongs to you.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:44.570
I'm passing everything on to you, my supporters and my donors.

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.150
Thank you.

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:55.350
I am Min Guk Hee, Candidate number seven.

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.350
Please put your faith in me.

00:56:57.850 --> 00:56:59.620
For the citizens of Seoul,

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:04.689
I am prepared to give my all.

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:08.030
- Min Guk Hee. - Min Guk Hee.

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:19.940
(Manager Dokgo)

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:26.880
Did you get home okay?

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.650
Your voice sounds worse. Are you really okay?

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.820
I'm fine.

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.460
I'll...

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:36.390
I'll call you back later.

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:51.109
Starting now, all meat is 50 percent off!

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:53.109
- Come on over. It's 50 percent off. - It's 50 percent off.

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:54.110
Fifty percent?

00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:56.739
- Meat is 50 percent off. - Meat is 50 percent off!

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:57.850
Fifty percent off meat?

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.279
- Here. - Here.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.649
- Gosh. What is this? - Let me. I was first.

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:04.889
- You already got yours. Move. - What?

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:06.820
- What? - Move!

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.659
- Move over. - Goodness.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.229
Starting now, for the next ten minutes,

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:13.759
we're having a 50 percent off sale.

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.030
- Here. - What are you doing?

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:16.999
- Is there more? - They have eels.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.200
- Eeels? - Eeels!

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:19.800
They have eels!

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.510
I want eels.

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:34.520
Alright, one eel and two octopuses. I'll clean them myself.

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:37.689
- Okay. - Thanks. Hold on.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.850
Yes. Two of them.

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.839
Yes. I'm sorry, but I'll have to call you back.

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:34.910
I'm here.

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.110
- You're where? - At your house, Detective.

00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:43.220
You came all the way here? Why?

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:46.820
You got hurt because of me. How could I just ignore it?

00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:50.530
I can't treat your wounds, but I can at least make porridge.

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:53.700
I'm telling you, I'm fine. Seriously.

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.229
Open the door.

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:57.799
What? You're already here?

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.439
I'm right outside your door. Hurry up!

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.740
This is really heavy.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:05.139
Just a second! Hold on.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.280
You must be in too much pain to even move.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.110
Then just tell me the passcode.

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:12.080
You stay put, and I'll let myself in.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.620
No, that's not it.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.020
Come on. Hurry. This is really heavy.

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:21.390
Well...

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:24.189
It's 0728. I'll be right out.

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:25.230
Hello?

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.200
Zero, seven...

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:47.280
I dedicate this award...

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.420
to 0728, who gave me great strength and courage.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.320
The pork gukbap from Busan has the deepest broth.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:56.719
For pork gukbap,

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.459
- you start with the clear broth. - You need to add salted shrimps.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.760
You have to season it with salted shrimp. Now, try it.

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:04.930
Isn't Busan your hometown?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.370
How did you know?

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.070
To all the people expecting the old Lim Se Ra,

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.680
the way I am now must be such a disappointment.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.980
Back then and now, you seem the same to me.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.320
I'm glad you're okay.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.490
I mean it.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.220
Okay. I'm coming.

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:43.900
(Epilogue)

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.440
Excuse me, Mr. Manager. Would you like a drink?

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:53.010
Thank you. Yes.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:56.110
Are you really a manager? I thought you were one of the actors.

01:02:56.810 --> 01:02:58.250
"An actor?" No way.

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.310
You could have fooled me.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.849
Because you're so handsome.

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:03.320
- Gosh. - I know.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.249
Goodness. Look at Mr. Dokgo. He's so popular.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.660
- My goodness! - I look better than Won Ban, right?

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:09.920
- Way better, totally! - Yes.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.289
- Thanks. - Se Ra.

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:12.759
All the female staff are going wild for him,

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.060
from young to old.

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:18.500
Good grief. You'd think he has his own fan club.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.040
He's just loving this.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.080
Oh, yes. Did you need something?

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:30.680
I could really go for a coffee.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.049
Okay. I'll run to the convenience store nearby and grab you one.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:35.180
No, not convenience store coffee.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.920
On the way to the set,

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.190
I saw there was a coffee shop at the edge of town.

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:41.820
Right. Yes.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.929
I'll go then. Yes.

01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:45.390
- Gosh. He's handsome. - Goodness.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.000
Wait. You're sending him to a place that is 20 minutes away,

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.070
just to buy you a coffee from a cafe?

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.070
I just got a sudden craving for coffee from that shop.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.340
- Oh, is that right? I see. - Yes.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:02.009
It's not because you hate to see him talking with the other female staff,

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.080
would it?

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.810
This is just how I am. Did you forget?

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.880
I guess I must have.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.950
Here you go.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.860
I figured it's hot out, so I got you an iced coffee.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.160
- Did you run all the way for this? - Well...

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.560
- Gosh. Look at you sweating. - I'm fine.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.330
Mr. Dokgo.

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:24.770
- Do you need coffee? - Yes?

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:26.630
- Coffee. - Hold on.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.600
- Excuse me? - Gosh. My legs are killing me.

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.340
- There isn't even a chair. - Oh, no.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.879
Hold on a second.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.949
I'll get you a chair right away.

01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:39.950
- Hold on a second. - I'm fine, really.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.549
- He's pretty good-looking. - Oh, my gosh.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.319
Why is the manager so handsome?

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.819
Right. He's more handsome than Won Ban.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.959
That's what I'm saying. He could be a secret actor.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.529
- He might be about to debut. - Are you sure he hasn't already?

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:53.260
Right. It's my first time seeing him.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:38.240
(My Troublesome Star)

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.740
There's really nothing? Nothing you've hidden or lied about?

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:46.250
- What? - I heard Won Ban liked Se Ra best.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:48.350
What is this?

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:50.549
I won't let my daughter ruin her life,

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:52.450
trying to become a celebrity like you.

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:55.860
Hey. I want to make the debut team, just like you.

01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:57.860
Where did Da Hee go?

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.930
Don't make a move on your own.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.360
- Help me! - Da Hee!

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.100
Aunt!
