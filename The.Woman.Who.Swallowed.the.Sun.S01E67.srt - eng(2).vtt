00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.210
Pack your bags and get out of this house!

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.280
(Episode 67)

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.080
If I leave, it'll be on my own terms.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.550
It won't be because you pushed me out.
I'll leave when I want to.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.320
Got it? Don't you dare threaten me
with that recording.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.760
You'd have better luck asking me nicely.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.190
Or you can go ahead and play it
for the chairman.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.690
You'll be the witch,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.530
and I'll be the monster.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.560
Go on, try it.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.540
So just keep your head down.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.740
Then I'll be the one to decide.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.690
After everything it took
for me to get here...

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.260
Leave?

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.000
Says who?

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.240
That Min Soo Jung has some nerve.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.670
How did she even think to record that?

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.870
I've shut her up for now,
but it won't last long.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.650
It's obvious she'll release the recording
and push her to get me thrown out.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.310
You're probably right.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.190
If you look closely,
she has more of a bite than her sister.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.790
Well, how could a mistress's daughter
become a successful Managing Director?

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.860
What's the update on Tae Joo?

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.700
Did he find that caregiver?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.800
It happened so long ago,
it's taking a while.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.940
That makes sense. It was 20 years ago.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.910
Tae Joo's looking hard for her,
so just hang on until he finds her.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.480
Don't you dare threaten me
with that recording.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.690
You'd have better luck asking me nicely.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.360
Or you can go ahead and play it
for the chairman.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.160
You'll be the witch,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.890
and I'll be the monster.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.930
Go on, try it.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.000
So she thinks she can do
whatever she wants now?

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.870
So what are you going to do now?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.340
About what?

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.310
Are you just going to let Lucia stay?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.740
I have to kick her out.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.710
I heard the argument
in your room yesterday.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.210
Don't just talk. Do it now.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.750
What's stopping you?

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.720
If you heard, then you should know
why I'm acting like this.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.560
Why would you make a deal
with a woman like her in the first place?

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.360
Did you really think Father's shares
would just fall into your hands?

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.800
Fine. I shot myself in the foot.
She's someone I shouldn't have crossed.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.100
I can't hand the recording over to Dad...

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.040
because my voice is on it too.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.770
He won't let it slide if he finds out.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.040
She's acting bold because of that,
and you're not going to give it to him?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.810
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.980
I'll get in trouble with Dad too.
It's not just her who's going down.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.950
Did you really not see this coming
when you started all this?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920
Fine, figure it out yourself then!

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.790
Unbelievable.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.130
Excuse me.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.400
Did the cleaning ladies not come in today?

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.770
Sorry?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.340
I asked if you've seen Ms. Oh Myeong Ja.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.870
I'm not sure, sir.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.480
All right.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.190
Seriously,
where on earth did that woman go?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.070
She must be here!

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.440
Where did she go, seriously!

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.610
Hey, can you check on someone for me?

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.380
She's one of the contract cleaners,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.650
she's not a full-timer, just a temp.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.780
Her name is Oh Myeong Ja.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.450
Really? So she didn't quit for good,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.320
she's just out for the day, is that it?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.730
Okay, got it.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.760
Suddenly absent today?

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.800
Something about this smells fishy.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.210
Ms. Oh Myeong Ja didn't come in today.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.080
I wonder what suddenly came up.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.080
Sorry? Who?

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.620
You must not know her name yet.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.550
You know,
the one in front of the elevator?

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.290
The cleaning lady
who acted like she knew you.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.290
Am I supposed to keep track
of her attendance?

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.090
She's not even in our department.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.960
Who is she? Is she important?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.470
She's very important to me.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.000
She knows an explosive secret.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.380
What are you talking about?

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.350
Please, don't pay it any mind.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.380
This is a big problem.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.490
If she tells Kim Sun Jae everything,
we're finished.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.660
Knowing him,
he's bound to report it to Chairman Min.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.560
Don't worry about that. I'll handle it.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.930
By the way, how's the background check
on Kim Sun Jae going?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.830
We're tracing his funds,
but it's not easy.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.300
That guy, Kim Sun Jae,
is annoyingly thorough.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.640
That's why he has the nerve
to play games with the slush fund...

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.340
behind the chairman's back.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.480
As long as we have the secret ledger
Kim Sun Jae was managing,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.820
we'll find what we're looking for
one way or another.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.150
Good.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.460
Because when the time comes
to make Min Doo Sik face the press,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.660
that will be the crucial evidence we need.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.630
Have you found a way?
A way to kick Lucia out of the house.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.870
Soo Jung has a crucial recording,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.800
but it'll be hard to use it.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.270
Because if she does,
Soo Jung might get kicked out too.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.580
Try to talk her into it.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.380
First, get that woman out of the house
by any means necessary,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.250
and then you can promise
to take care of Soo Jung.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.280
You're telling me
to take care of Soo Jung?

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.250
If you have to, you have to.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.320
It's better than you letting Lucia stay.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.590
You two need to team up right now.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.100
I'll give her one thing.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.460
She's actually managed
to unite us sisters.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.030
We have no choice.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.100
To get rid of a common enemy,

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.300
you have to be willing
to join forces with anyone.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.410
You have a point.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.310
Right now, I want her gone more
for Se Ri's sake than for my father's.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.420
I have a feeling she's putting
strange ideas into Se Ri's head.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.220
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.560
Come here.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.600
I feel like I gave birth to you myself.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.340
I'm not sure why I feel that way, though.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.710
Me too.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.210
You feel more like my real mom
than my stepmom.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.910
That's a relief.
I'm glad the feeling's mutual.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.320
So, on that note,

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.320
I need you to listen to what I say
with an open mind.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.120
Can you do that for me?

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.460
What is it?

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.760
Tell me what it is.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.670
I don't want you to talk
to Kyung Chae anymore.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.710
When people talk to each other a lot,
they start to grow alike, like it or not.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.510
I don't want you to become
like Kyung Chae.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.050
Of course,
Kyung Chae is capable and smart.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.750
But I would hate for you to be that cold
and heartless.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.450
You mean...

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.560
you don't want me to talk to Kyung Chae?

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.890
You can do that, can't you?

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.960
You only need to talk to me.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.630
I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.100
Min Kyung Chae.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.370
From now on, your daughter will treat you
like a stranger for the rest of her life.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.110
You'll want to speak,
but your own child won't listen.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.280
You'll want to listen,
but she won't say a word.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.980
Now you'll know how that feels
for a mother.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.450
My pretty girl.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.490
We're looking for proof that Kim Sun Jae
is managing a double ledger.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.230
The ledger you gave me
will one day be used...

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.530
to take Chairman Min
and Kim Sun Jae to court.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.900
Make sure you do.
That's why I gave it to you.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.010
But it seems Chairman Min Doo Sik...

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.680
has no idea he's being played
by Lawyer Kim.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.550
It looks like the funds are being funneled
into one particular account.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.850
It's probably Kim Sun Jae's
borrowed-name account.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.690
That must be how he's managing
and siphoning off the slush fund.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.990
He pretends to be a loyal subordinate,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.460
but behind his back,
he's just lining his own pockets.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.560
Do you think we can prosecute him
without the other ledgers?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.330
I'll have to make it happen.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.500
Separate from Chairman Min Doo Sik,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.730
if we want to prosecute Kim Sun Jae
for financial crimes,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.410
that ledger is going to be
our key evidence.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.010
Are you feeling all right?

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.620
I heard you had a terrible headache.
I was so worried when I got the call.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.790
I know. I've been getting these headaches
more often lately.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.090
It could be a side effect of the surgery.
You should go see a doctor.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.260
Or, I can take you if you'd like.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.000
The hospital? Don't be ridiculous.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.230
See? I'm telling you, this is serious.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.000
If you're that worried, stay by my side.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.200
We're not separated,

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.770
so what's this about sleeping
in Se Ri's room every night?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.410
Se Ri has just finally calmed down.
I can't just ignore her now, can I?

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.150
She's not a child. She's a grown woman.
Can't she sleep on her own?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.880
It's because I want to be the one
to look after her.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.120
Se Ri is my daughter.
If I don't take care of her, who will?

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.790
Stop fussing and get some sleep.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.460
Gosh.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.910
We have no choice.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.040
To get rid of a common enemy,

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.110
you have to be willing
to join forces with anyone.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.180
Team up with Soo Jung?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.320
So, to get rid of Lucia,
that's what it takes?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.930
But still...

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.660
How could I possibly work with Soo Jung?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.450
So, what's your plan now?

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.710
How long are you going to let that woman
live under our roof?

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.120
You made this mess,
so you have to clean it up.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.720
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.090
Just release the recording. Don't think.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.360
And what happens to me?

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.860
I told her to extort Dad's assets.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.400
Do you think he'll just let that slide?

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.370
I'll take care of that part.
For now, just let him hear the recording.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.370
What are you going to do?

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:17.010
If Father finds out about your deal,
he won't just sit back and do nothing.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.610
But that's not what's important right now.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.110
First, we need to kick that woman out.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.950
And I'll smooth things over with Father,
so don't worry.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.620
Can I really trust you?

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.220
I mean it.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.730
At least on this issue,
you and I are on the same team.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.360
Don't you understand what that means?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.900
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.840
Chairman, what's wrong?

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.810
- Are you not feeling well, sir?
- It's this headache.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.210
Have you been to the hospital?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.580
The hospital? Don't be ridiculous.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.150
Oh, right,
what's the status on that matter?

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.550
Did you find out who that guy
you were looking into is?

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.790
Actually, I'm on my way
to confirm that right now.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.460
I'll report back to you once I have.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.430
But, sir, this person you're looking for,

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.130
what exactly is the story behind them?

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.060
How are they connected to you?

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.430
You don't need to know all that.
Just find out who it is.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.770
Gosh.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.710
What in the world is this all about?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.210
This can't be good.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.150
Anyway, if Moon Tae Kyung is the person
the chairman's looking for,

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.850
then it's game over for him.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.360
Ms. Oh Myeong Ja. You and I need to talk.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.570
Follow me.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.540
Why were you absent?

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.610
I had a family matter to attend to.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.110
Isn't it about time you told me the truth?

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.280
The truth can't stay buried forever.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.950
You're right.
The truth shouldn't be buried.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.220
Right? Now we're finally on the same page.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.690
That man, Moon Tae Kyung, is actually...

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.030
Actually?

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.730
He really is Moon Tae Kyung.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.000
That's his real name.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.070
Are you messing with me?

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.140
Didn't you mention
something about CEO Han earlier?

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.840
Moon Tae Kyung is Moon Tae Kyung!
What else would he be?

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.180
I can't believe this woman...

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.780
Hey, do you want to get fired?
Because I can arrange that.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.050
Good grief.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.350
I'm quitting.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.090
I have to take care of my sick husband.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.860
That darn woman...

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.130
What's giving her all this confidence?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.670
Yes. What happened with Oh Myeong Ja's
husband at Hankuk Hospital?

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.310
What? His hospital bill was paid for him?

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.780
When? Who paid it?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.050
What did you say?

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.410
Moon Tae Kyung?

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.820
So this is your way of buying her silence?

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.130
Moon Tae Kyung, you and I are the same.
There's no difference between us.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.860
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.300
Were you terrified I'd blow your cover?

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.700
You're quite skilled at buying people off.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:34.200
Watch your mouth.
Do you take me for someone like you?

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.110
I have nothing shady to hide
that would require me to bribe someone,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.380
and unlike you, I don't have
a sordid past to cover up.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.450
Then why did you pay the cleaning lady's
husband's hospital bills?

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.920
Oh, that.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.450
It's called goodwill. Goodwill.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.950
But I wouldn't expect you
to understand that.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.060
Who the heck are you, really?

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.390
What's your real identity,
if not Moon Tae Kyung?

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.270
I am Moon Tae Kyung.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.300
That is who I am. That is everything.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.240
I hear Tae Joo found the caregiver.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.840
He did?

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.940
Isn't it time you made your move?

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.150
By now, the two foxes of the Min family
have probably put their heads together,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.980
scheming to kick you out.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.890
I'm sure they are.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.690
If the sisters cross the line now,
that'll be something to see.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.260
If his daughters get into a catfight,
that'll be quite the spectacle, too.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.900
Min Doo Sik will be absolutely livid.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.940
Only when he's fed up with his children
will he truly appreciate the woman he has.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.410
That's the only way he'll give you
a share of his company.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.180
I'm going to tell Dad tonight.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.650
You should do it
when the whole family is there.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.420
That way, everyone will find out
what kind of woman Lucia really is.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.550
Keep your promise first.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.630
You said I wouldn't get on Dad's bad side
over this.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.490
I already told you I would.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.800
But have we ever been on the same page
like this before?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.170
I know, right?
Should we be thanking Lucia for this?

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.280
Make tonight D-day and play the recording
in front of the family.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.980
Once Father knows Lucia's true colors,
he'll come to his senses.

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:26.250
Bringing in the wrong woman brings ruin.
It really can happen to anyone.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.790
And you got in cahoots with her
without realizing that?

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.090
I already told you that was my mistake!

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.090
Father is heading straight home
after his meeting,

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.260
so drop the bomb at the right time.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.570
I'll call home and let them know.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.240
Yes, Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.980
This evening?

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.710
Is there a special occasion?

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.950
I have an important announcement.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.280
Yes, I understand.
I'll have everyone gather.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.150
What's going on?

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.190
Ms. Soo Jung is making
a major announcement tonight,

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.360
and Ms. Kyung Chae told me
to gather the family.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.600
A major announcement?

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.700
Is she announcing her wedding
or something?

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.370
No, not that.
She says it's about the chairman.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.870
My father-in-law?

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.720
It's me.
Looks like they'll drop the bomb tonight.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.830
Put him on the phone.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.200
My goodness, welcome, my dear in-law.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.600
You've finally paid us a visit.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.170
What in the world is going on?
Why did you call us here?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.810
Gosh, I know.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:56.910
Honey, really.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.840
For business,
you should've visited his office.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.680
Why bring the chairman to such a place?

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.810
He's such a busy man.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.710
Now, now, my beautiful lady. Just hold on.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.880
We can't discuss everything at the office.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.720
What is it you want to talk about?
Is it some big secret?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.490
Honey, could you bring out some fruit?
We haven't even offered our guest a drink.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.190
My goodness, where are my manners?

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.590
Please wait a moment, sir.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.500
Just get to the point.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.640
I have somewhere to be.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.280
Should I say it or not?
Why did that son of a thief...

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.140
have to sneak into my house
and make off with the safe?

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.880
And why, out of all
the collateral in there,

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.390
was that contract the only thing taken?
Did you put him up to it?

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.890
You dragged me here, so get to the point.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.820
Am I supposed to wait all day?

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.660
By the way, about that contract...

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.830
I mean the tech transfer agreement with
Han Kyung Soo from Doeun Industries.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.900
Oh, that. I was just wondering about that.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.670
I trust you're keeping it safe?

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.900
After all, that's your leverage, isn't it?

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.370
You blackmailed me with it to get
that non-executive director position.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.980
What kind of bizarre thing
are you saying now?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.110
Blackmail? Me? Blackmail you?

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.180
I'd never do such a thing.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.990
Or am I wrong?
Am I barking up the wrong tree here?

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:20.660
I was just making sure
you knew I had it as collateral.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.390
- It wasn't blackmail.
- Then you'd better keep it safe.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.630
You never know
when it might come in handy again.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.380
What do you think you're doing here?

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.410
What's with this attitude?
Where are your manners?

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.980
Is that any way to talk to your mother?

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.150
Spare me the "mother" routine.
When I told you to get out of the house,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.790
I meant you should stay away
from the company, too.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.020
Get out of my way.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.830
So, you won't listen to reason.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.360
I said, get out of my way!

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.530
Listen here, Lucia!

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.650
Look at you, getting all desperate.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.790
Because you'll be flat broke
once you're kicked out of our house.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.230
Trying to stay in the old Chairman's
good graces till the end, is that it?

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.000
I'm not going anywhere,
but even if I were to leave,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.370
I am still your mother
until that day comes.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.270
How dare you speak to me like that?

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.570
I've been patient, but this is too much.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.040
Min Kyung Chae and I
are going to kick you out.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.210
And you know Min Kyung Chae
always follows through, don't you?

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.250
You poor, foolish girl.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.820
You and Min Kyung Chae can never be
on the same team.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.720
What's that supposed to mean?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.790
The chairman could arrive any minute,
and this isn't the place to talk.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.430
To your office. Lead the way.
I'll explain what you're not getting.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.210
Fine. What is it I don't get?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.340
I said, what is it?

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.380
It's about your mother.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.490
(Place of death: Hospital)

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.090
Night Sky Nursing Home.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.100
It's gone now, but 20 years ago,
it was on the outskirts of Gyeonggi-do.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.130
It was a private nursing facility.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.670
A place for alcoholics without guardians,
elderly dementia patients,

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.940
and terminally ill patients
with no hope of recovery.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.140
They called it a nursing home,
but it was a locked-down psychiatric ward.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.220
What in the world is this?

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.920
Why would my mom have been
in a place like this?

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.250
My mom...

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.920
She cut off all contact and went abroad
so she wouldn't be a burden to me...

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.130
In exchange for ensuring your safety,

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.760
your mother agreed to go there.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.230
So you, as part of Mingang's royal family,

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.330
could live a glamorous life.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.300
You're lying.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.670
If you don't believe me, come and see.
There's a witness.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.180
A witness? Who?

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.220
How can you prove that my mother died...

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.450
in a nursing home?

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.720
Over here.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.500
Hello.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.100
She was the caregiver assigned
to your mother, Park Mi Sook.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.610
She was with your mother
in her final moments.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.310
The only witness.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.120
These are the patient Park Mi Sook's
personal effects.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.020
No one came to claim them
after she passed away,

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.260
so I've been keeping them safe.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.810
Tell her how Park Mi Sook ended up there.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.940
Tell her. I'm sure she's curious.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.550
It must have been 20 years ago.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.550
A patient who checked themselves
into the nursing home,

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.250
that was a first for us,

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.150
so I remember it vividly.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.790
My mom...

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.090
checked herself in there voluntarily?

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.630
Why would a perfectly healthy person
do that?

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.870
Unless someone made her feel like...

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.670
she had no other choice.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.740
She had someone with her then, didn't she?

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.010
Someone with her?

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640
Who was it?

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.510
Who forced my mom into this?

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.050
No way...

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.450
Is it this woman?

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.290
Yes, that's her.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.760
She looks a bit older than she did then,

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.960
I'd recognize her anywhere.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.960
Where's Min Kyung Chae?

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.030
(Mingang Distribution)

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.670
Min Kyung Chae!

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.140
What on earth is going on?

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.240
What's this announcement
Soo Jung is supposed to make?

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.480
Is she announcing her wedding
or something?

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.050
That's what I thought,
but I don't think that's it.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.350
It's more important than a wedding.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.190
Then what is it?

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.260
Let's just wait.
We'll find out when Soo Jung gets here.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.860
Do I really have to be here?
I just want to go to my room.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.200
Stay put.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.370
Our whole family needs to know this today.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.600
An important truth
is about to be revealed.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.870
Is it something shocking?

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.340
Should I take something for my nerves?
Should we be bracing ourselves?

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.080
It'll be a shock to someone, I'm sure.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.850
Because their disgusting true self
will be revealed.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.980
And they've managed to hide it so well.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.290
Soo Jung might just drag them out
by their hair.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.090
Who's getting their hair dragged?

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.170
Are you out of your mind?

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.740
Let go of me!

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.310
Let go!

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.380
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not the crazy one!

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.250
Hey! Let go!

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720
Hey!

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.390
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.450
There's no way Min Kyung Chae will become
the chairwoman of Mingang Distribution.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.350
I'll do whatever it takes to stop her.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.090
If the three of them are a team,
then Stella Jang and Moon Tae Kyung...

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.120
must also have some history with Mingang
or Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.790
- Is Min Kyung Chae next on the list?
- It won't be easy.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.460
It'll take more than this.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.760
Find someone for me.
An obscure painter named Jung Ho Se.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.130
I looked into the matter you mentioned.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.300
I can confirm the artist has passed away.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400
Are you sure?

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.840
