WEBVTT

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.680
Whoa, so impressive.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.770
The ceilings is so high.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.350
My secretary, Fumi

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.450
and my friend Himeka, why are you here?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.600
Hello.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.380
I came to welcome my friend back.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.880
Ever the thoughtful one, Himeka.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.440
I'm Kaishin.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.570
Where is Ai-san's room?

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.000
On the second floor.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.580
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.400
What are you doing?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Nothing. Just going to his room.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.470
No entry for outsiders.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.280
Let him in.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.930
Teacher.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.530
Even I'm not allowed in there.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.450
How can you... let him in?!

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.430
Because...

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.830
if he can't enter the room

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.360
where are we supposed to have sex?

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.720
Have...

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.830
Already bought him, gotta get my money's worth.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.230
You have a point.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.010
Or would you like to check here if I'm worth the price?

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.630
So crude...

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.670
Ai

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.810
is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.430
like a dad!

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.710
Wait.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.310
What.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.950
Wait.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.160
Tomorrow

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190
don't we have a contract meeting early morning?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.830
Alright.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.370
Go back home quickly.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.750
You too, Himeka.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.840
Okay.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.230
I haven't finished talking.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.440
I don't know why you trust him

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.630
but this suspicious guy

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.230
who knows what he's hiding!

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.590
Now that you mention it...

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.680
Right?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.200
Tomorrow.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.960
Let's get him checked out at the hospital.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.010
Fumi.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.280
Schedule a full checkup for him with my family doctor.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.160
Oh, and...

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.040
STD test, too.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.610
Why me?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.950
Who am I?

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.000
The boss.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.210
Good night.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.700
Let's go.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.120
You can leave the bag here.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.600
You're sleeping in the guest room downstairs.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.080
Huh?

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.460
I'm...

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.790
not letting you into my bed.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.800
"Love Sea The Home for Lovers"
(Episode 6)

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.810
Big brother is so cruel, abandoning me.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.400
You heartless guy

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.150
I'll wire you the money.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.310
Huh?

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.880
You're the best, man!

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.850
Only a bunch of alcohol.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.210
By the way

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.340
when are you coming back?

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.430
Haven't decided. All I know is I'm going to the hospital today.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.000
Are you sick?

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.480
No, it's not like that.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.630
There's a sleepy cat

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.030
and a paranoid mouse.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.960
Well then

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.370
please sign here.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.090
Thank you very much.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.350
Alright

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.070
we will proceed with the rest of the paperwork.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.260
Okay

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.050
I'll leave it in your hands.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.550
Thank you for your help.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.600
Thank you very much.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.410
Thank you.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.300
Thank you.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.950
We're entrusting this to you.
Thank you for your hard work.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.440
They promised to strengthen patrols during school hours.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.220
Sorry for making you worry.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.650
Teacher.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.450
Teacher Ai.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.540
Can you please reconsider?

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.840
Huh? The contract we just signed?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.220
No

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.840
I'm talking about that man.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.970
Buying a man is utterly ridiculous.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.660
If this gets out online,
your popular writer career is ruined.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.180
I don't do returns.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.790
You seriously want to spend your future with him?

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.690
Of course not!

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.570
But...

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.540
this is what I decided.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.830
In that case, I've got an idea.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.640
Hmm?

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.530
Today's test results are on the table.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.520
Looks like it's okay even if we run out of condoms.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.570
Shut up!

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.940
And what are you cooking,
acting like this is totally normal?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.420
If you eat raw pork, all those tests would be wasted.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.470
I told you not to cook

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.680
order takeout...!

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.570
It's cheaper to cook it on our own.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.060
Teacher Ai doesn't eat food like this.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.340
Why not?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.660
Does he drink gasoline or something?

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.500
Maybe.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.190
What is he, a monster?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.560
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.550
Huh?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.980
Ai-san is incredible.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.420
He's someone who drinks gasoline.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.550
Please don't say that with respect.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.850
Yes.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.130
Please ask if anything is unclear.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.260
This is...

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.040
A cohabitation agreement.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.080
If there's anything you disagree with or lacks,
please tell me.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.130
It mainly outlines the obligations for both of you.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.140
Teacher will pay for living expenses.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.800
And you can't do things the teacher dislikes.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.960
Party A reserves the right of termination.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.070
Meaning if Ai-san gets tired of me,
he can just kick me out whenever?

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.470
Precisely.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.970
What if I refuse?

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.590
That's not an option.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.870
This is non-negotiable.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.820
Name your conditions.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.480
If you want to study, he'll send you.
He'll support anything you want to do.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.200
However...

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.060
non-negotiable terms must be followed.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.660
Especially...

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.730
the prohibition of romance.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.210
I agree.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.360
Then let's continue.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.590
Payment will be made monthly.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.650
Food, accommodation, and other necessary
expenses will be covered separately.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.370
Do writers make that much money?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.580
Besides novels

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.180
there are other income sources.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.390
And...

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.660
my family was rich originally.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.530
So...

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.010
how much do you want?

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:05.760
Whatever you decide

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.130
I'll let Ai-san decide.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.840
Then the agreement is done.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.370
Is it good?

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.550
Delicious.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.950
Now officially a sugar daddy on paper.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.660
So you approve.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.300
I do not approve.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.470
This is a temporary arrangement.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.430
Ai-san is my sugar daddy?

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:53.300
Hmm?

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.060
Isn't he?

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.350
I'm the kitten's daddy.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.520
Well, Ai has good taste.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.820
What's good about it?

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:03.810
Huh?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.130
Upset that your beloved teacher was taken away?

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.750
- I didn't mean that.
- Well, it can't be helped.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.630
Women don't have "that thing".

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.110
Exactly.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.870
Though I love Fumi

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.710
since she doesn't have "that thing".

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.770
I can't love her in that way.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.930
You're both the same.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.440
Birds of a feather.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.740
Thick as thieves.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.170
So, in other words...

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.430
I have "that thing," you love me.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.700
How wonderful.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.610
It's easier to love someone than to abandon them.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.180
Well?

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.240
So boring.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.790
Just one thing...

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.700
I want to buy spare clothes.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.900
Where's a good store?

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.760
Fumi.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.610
Go buy some for him tomorrow.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.270
Me?

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.020
Food, clothing, and housing guarantee.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.130
Isn't that in the contract?

00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.520
Or...

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.480
You want me to go?

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.950
Well then.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.770
Sorry, please get me some underwear, too.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:04.770
Underwear!

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.590
You heard.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.450
Underwear.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.450
Underwear!

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.200
Why...

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.280
is it me?

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.710
Environmental protection is in your hands, go for it.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.190
Thanks for dropping me off.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.620
I signed it.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.040
So now, I'm all yours, Ai-san.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.420
Also...

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.460
About the terms.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.420
Anything else you want to add?

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.600
No.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.930
About the prohibition of romance...

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.850
It means exactly what it says.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.210
I have no interest in those romantic fantasies...

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.670
and think they're a waste of time.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.780
Between us...

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.850
there will only be sex, that's the contract.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.300
You don't believe in love.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.680
I'm so sick of hearing that.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.630
But some things can't be bound by written words.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.220
You can't stop me from loving you.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.260
I could never love you.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.480
Kissing isn't prohibited.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.250
Right?

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.500
You are forbidden from doing anything I dislike.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.590
I like it.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.890
Call me anytime

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.670
I will be at your service.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.210
What just happened...

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.030
Think it over.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.000
Don't command me.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.490
I will guide you.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.240
Understand..

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:22.520
New book...

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.700
Urban.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.640
What is love...

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.990
Love is too boring.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.460
You're too conspicuous.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.740
Radiating star aura

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.310
I'm not hiding.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.220
It's your day off, you don't have to be with me.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.340
Even on vacation I get photographed

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.850
I don't really have holidays.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.180
Since I'll be photographed anyway...

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.250
might as well use "Crazy for New Love" as the headline.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.490
Shirts and...

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.850
pants...

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.720
buy ten sets each for replacement...

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.810
planning to wear them to the next life?

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.680
Who knows...

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.460
Teacher Ai...

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.710
did he fall into that person's trap?

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.020
I wouldn't call it a trap...

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.260
he might have fallen in love.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.960
What?

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.170
What's there to worry about?

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.490
I'm worried.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.430
Shouldn't you be more excited?

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.130
Ai Rakumoto...

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.650
maybe he can get rid of the destructive writing style.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.620
This might be his last chance.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.800
Let's go.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.560
- Let's get something to eat first.
- Okay.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.490
What do you want?

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.600
You're awake.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.920
Don't barge in without permission

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.050
I knocked, and I'm hungry.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.760
- You can order delivery.
- My phone's dead.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.770
Let's go out to eat.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.000
- I have no appetite.
- The contract guarantees my food, clothing, housing.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.940
I'm really starving.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.020
You said it yourself, didn't you?

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.300
That you'd do anything Kaishin asks.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.980
I want to eat with you, Ai-san.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.250
Please.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.770
Quiet water...

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.600
Spring water...

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.760
What can I get for you?

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.300
The assorted stew...

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.930
I'll have clear broth mountain vegetables sweetfish,
fried bamboo fish balls, and miso grilled duck.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.180
How about you?

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.420
You can just order for me, Ai-san.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.450
Anything is fine.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.060
Alright then...

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.340
fresh tofu skin, fan-shaped turnip tempura,
Hida beef and spring water pork loin.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.040
And two cold-brewed green teas.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:46.770
Yes, right away.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.590
We can share, if you like.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.320
Sounded like a spell.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.600
Sorry for embarrassing you.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.940
Who made you think that?

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.700
Was it the waiter just now?

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.870
Where are you going?

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.380
I'll talk to him.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.540
Why?

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.400
Because I'm pissed.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.790
You're a customer here...

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.590
everyone has a first time...

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.610
no reason to be looked down on.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.030
What are you smiling about?

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.710
I'm just happy.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.530
If you didn't care about me, you wouldn't be angry.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.560
Of course.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.220
Since returning to the city,
you only stay home working.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.630
You didn't even eat the food I cooked.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.040
I was actually really hurt.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.740
You're not that fragile

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.140
I'm not fragile.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.770
But I have a soft spot for the person I like.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.560
I don't like you.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.360
You don't like me... yet.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.410
I'm sorry.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.380
I try not to eat when writing.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.720
It breaks my concentration.

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.930
Replacing meals with snacks is bad for health.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.520
That's my lifestyle.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.770
I'll take care of you.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.780
Don't turn all your earnings into medical bills.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.270
Making money to see doctors, taking medicine as meals.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.400
I won't let that happen to you.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.180
Okay, enough preaching.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.940
After all, we're on a date.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:39.690
Huh?

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.000
We're just eating out.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.060
In Ai-san's novel I read last night

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.480
the main character called eat out a date.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.360
And then they kissed.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.910
So...

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.760
don't we need to kiss to that extent?

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.110
If this were a novel now...

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.160
you'd hear a sizzle sound...

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.370
even his ears turn red.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.150
Right?

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.270
Get away from me.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.380
Why?

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.620
Fine, I get it.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.150
- You bought a lot of pants.
- Sure did.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.780
The hamburger steak was delicious, too.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.690
So good, I ordered another one.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.460
Wonder if Teacher Ai is home

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.740
I'll call and ask.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.240
Fumi, even if you don't look after him so much...

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.490
someone else will take care of him, okay?

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:35.910
Someone else?

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.050
His boyfriend.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.250
No way.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:41.600
That guy...

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.240
He said he hasn't even read teacher's novels.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.730
So I lent him one.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.990
Which one did you lend him?

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.650
The one that got an adaptation last year.
Himeka-san was in it, too.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.020
Ah.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.480
The main character is a selfish waste

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.820
who buys men with money.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.070
When I read the manuscript, I told teacher

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.820
that he definitely needs punishment.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.060
And what happened?

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.100
"I already finished writing."

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.590
"Too lazy to change it."

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.100
"Take your revenge in your head."

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.410
He completely destroys readers' fantasies.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.630
Fumi, you really...

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.520
love Ai's novels.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.460
That's because...

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.460
they changed my life.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.170
Having a fan like you nearby.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.190
Ai is very fortunate.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.550
Fans staying nearby...

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.920
isn't that creepy?

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.200
Not really.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.190
Although...

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.030
being too close is troublesome.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.060
It is a fan and celebrity relationship after all.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.000
I forgot about an online meeting

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.690
I'll excuse myself.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.610
Fumi?

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.240
How about this one?

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:21.860
This one?

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:27.960
And this one.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:28.710
Okay.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.290
Also...

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.980
Mmm.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.650
Buying them for yourself is one thing...

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:40.900
but these are for me, right?

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.210
Right

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.910
I won't let anyone look down on you again.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.920
Get his measurements.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.540
What?

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.970
Kaishin.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.340
- Even if locked up I'd buy.
- Because you're my sugar daddy?

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.940
Too pitiful without designer brands to transform me?

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.860
I don't think that way.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.780
If Ai-san thinks I'm pathetic, then I am pathetic.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.320
I only care about what the people who matter say.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.950
Being looked down on by others doesn't matter.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.180
I...

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.530
don't think so.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.130
This is a fitting room.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.870
People outside will think we're just trying things on inside.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.930
Just like in a novel.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.090
You're too into character.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.760
Does it fit?

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.280
It fits

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.200
I'll be right out.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.350
You bought too much.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.960
I'm not looking down on you.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.240
And I'm not pitying you.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.350
And don't plan to make you obey with money.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.400
This is just a returning

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:12.670
returning?

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.130
Unbelievable.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.060
There's a celebrity over there!

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:53.780
You're in the way.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.830
Don't touch me

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.000
I'm pouring coffee.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:09.650
Go over there.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.830
What's wrong.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.790
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.620
Look...

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.390
Anyone would be angry, right?

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.810
If their bought man flirted with others...

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:30.910
I'll get the coffee

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.090
I'll stay outside after this.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.880
I'm annoying, right?

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.010
Where are you going?

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.800
I...

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.230
Are you abandoning me?

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:49.820
We...

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.120
Finish what you were saying.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.910
Let's make up.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.180
Huh?

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.450
No one's here.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.550
Brother~.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.360
What are you doing here?

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.290
Same as always, ignoring me.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.090
Look over here.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.960
Long time no see.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.810
Brother~.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.420
I only have one older sister.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.330
Everyone else is a stranger.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.990
Hey, do normal people consider cousins strangers?

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.940
Good evening, I'm Rin.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.060
Ah...

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.060
You're brother's current sex buddy?

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.790
Pretty rustic looking though.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:00.960
Don't you have anything to do?

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.420
Going around announcing your stupidity.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.370
Seems you're free.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.070
Well... I'm just worried about you.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.270
Worried?

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.450
Our only sister's divorce was bad enough.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.570
You doing this will shame our family, right?

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.010
How's your lover doing?

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:23.430
Huh?

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.320
- Don't change the subject.
- This is a family matter, too.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.230
When you invested in his business...

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.850
Ah! Just shut up!

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.190
I'm telling Mom you insulted me

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.780
I didn't insult you...

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.140
People in our family...

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.370
all live by depending on men.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.880
I'm different.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.980
I don't buy men with money.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.420
I'm just lending him money.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.370
Yeah, right.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.080
Ai-san.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.250
Just leave me alone.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:06.830
But...

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.360
You haven't told me what you want to eat yet.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.030
Since we're buying underwear anyway...

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.080
let's pick one that will make Ai laugh.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.500
It's not like we're buying underwear for teacher.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:05.520
But...

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:06.990
Ai's the one who'll be taking them off, right?

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.050
Fumi.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.110
You're so cute.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:18.940
You really love to tease people.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.720
Should we go buy lingerie, too?

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.410
No way.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.960
Hey, come on.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.000
- Please, it would suit you.
- No way.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.360
I think red would be better

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.960
I didn't ask you.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.140
Lace would suit you.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.880
Lace...

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.740
Lace or those fitted styles...

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:40.890
You know

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.100
cute styles?

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.540
- No way...
- Why not? Please!
