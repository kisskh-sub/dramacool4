00:00:00.953 --> 00:00:01.953
Die!

00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:03.213
Die!

00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:04.783
Please just die!

00:00:04.783 --> 00:00:05.853
Die!

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:12.163
(Episode 92)

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:26.303
You think killing me will solve everything?

00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:30.413
Did you think all your secrets...

00:00:31.543 --> 00:00:33.483
would just be covered up?

00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:37.053
Too bad.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:39.653
You didn't manage to kill me.

00:00:41.523 --> 00:00:42.553
Just you wait.

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:46.123
Tae Ho, I only did it because I was scared.

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:51.133
I was afraid if you told everyone, our whole family would fall apart,

00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:53.303
and I was terrified that everything would be ruined.

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:55.173
So, to protect everything you have,

00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:00.443
you figured it wouldn't matter if a guy like me just disappeared.

00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:03.383
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:01:03.843 --> 00:01:06.043
I wasn't thinking straight. I must've lost my mind.

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:08.613
Would you be apologising like this if I were dead?

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:11.453
Kang Se Ri.

00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:13.653
You brought this all on yourself.

00:01:14.293 --> 00:01:18.193
Now, watch it all come crashing down.

00:01:19.623 --> 00:01:22.333
Tae Ho, No! Please spare me!

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:24.333
I'm sorry.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:25.663
I'm so sorry.

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.733
If it's money you want, I'll give you whatever you ask for.

00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:30.033
So, about what happened today...

00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:31.403
No, about us...

00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:32.743
Please don't tell Gi Chan.

00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:34.943
If you want,

00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:37.083
I'll even let you see Ji Ho whenever you want.

00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:38.413
I mean it.

00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:41.553
I can see Ji Ho whenever I want.

00:01:41.913 --> 00:01:43.083
He's my son.

00:01:44.183 --> 00:01:45.423
I don't need your permission.

00:01:46.183 --> 00:01:48.393
Please keep this a secret for Ji Ho.

00:01:48.923 --> 00:01:50.963
I'm his mother. Please, I'm begging you.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.233
I haven't changed my mind about taking Ji Ho.

00:01:55.763 --> 00:01:57.163
This makes me more determined.

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:01.533
Better get things in order as soon as possible.

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:19.923
You're home early. Did you tell him?

00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:21.353
Yes.

00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:24.093
- What did he say? - He must've been shocked.

00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:25.593
I can only imagine.

00:02:26.263 --> 00:02:28.993
Of course. He probably never saw it coming.

00:02:29.863 --> 00:02:31.233
He was pretty taken aback.

00:02:32.403 --> 00:02:34.633
He'll need some time to process it.

00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:38.803
I'm still processing it myself, so I'm sure he is too.

00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:42.513
I'll wait. I can wait as long as he needs.

00:02:42.973 --> 00:02:44.613
Just take your time getting to know each other.

00:02:44.883 --> 00:02:46.243
Blood is thicker than water.

00:02:46.643 --> 00:02:47.953
So, don't worry too much.

00:02:48.483 --> 00:02:51.123
And don't even think about trying to patch things up with that woman.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:53.453
Just focus on your relationship with your son.

00:02:54.353 --> 00:02:55.353
Yun Hee.

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:58.623
Can't you be a little more open-minded about this?

00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:00.493
She's still his mother, after all.

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:02.463
I'm not saying she isn't his mother.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.763
Just tell her to stick to being a mother and nothing more.

00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:14.373
What is it, Bo Ram?

00:03:14.713 --> 00:03:16.843
What's with the sudden sigh?

00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:23.083
I don't get what the three of you are saying.

00:03:25.783 --> 00:03:26.823
I see.

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:30.623
Don't you think we should explain it to Bo Ram now?

00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:33.323
Bo Ram.

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:38.663
Do you remember the handsome guy who visited us the other day?

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:40.973
Yes, I remember him.

00:03:41.673 --> 00:03:44.543
He's my son.

00:03:44.903 --> 00:03:47.243
He takes after me, so he's really handsome.

00:03:50.783 --> 00:03:51.783
Surprised?

00:03:52.283 --> 00:03:53.283
Yes...

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:55.583
Do Yun, is it true?

00:03:58.223 --> 00:04:00.653
But he isn't handsome.

00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:05.623
The handsome guy really is his son.

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:08.493
So that means he's your uncle.

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.103
Now you have many uncles, Bo Ram.

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:16.103
You have another uncle now. You're so lucky.

00:04:25.443 --> 00:04:26.613
Good morning.

00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:28.353
Jae In?

00:04:29.113 --> 00:04:31.583
I start working here today. You know that, right?

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:35.193
So you're back to your true self?

00:04:35.623 --> 00:04:38.423
Yes. It's time to get back to who I really am.

00:04:41.063 --> 00:04:42.063
Good morning.

00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:44.803
Oh, my.

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:47.373
Your style's so different, I almost didn't recognise you.

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:49.773
Everyone's reaction is making this awkward.

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:51.773
I guess I should have come as Designer L.

00:04:52.273 --> 00:04:54.173
- No. - No!

00:05:00.713 --> 00:05:03.383
What I mean is, this is more like the real you.

00:05:03.883 --> 00:05:04.883
It really suits you.

00:05:04.953 --> 00:05:07.193
I think you look great no matter what.

00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:08.623
You're beautiful.

00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:10.423
Oh, honestly.

00:05:12.193 --> 00:05:13.193
Come in.

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:19.433
I need to talk to you.

00:05:23.843 --> 00:05:27.373
(DH Holdings)

00:05:27.443 --> 00:05:28.473
Stop crying.

00:05:29.443 --> 00:05:30.613
Didn't you say you wanted to talk?

00:05:33.853 --> 00:05:35.413
I really didn't know.

00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:40.283
I was so wrapped up in my own trauma from the fire.

00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:43.053
I had no idea...

00:05:43.623 --> 00:05:46.563
your family were suffering because of what I did.

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:48.963
I really had no idea...

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.563
she would embezzle the insurance money.

00:05:53.973 --> 00:05:56.433
You were just a kid. Of course, you didn't know.

00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:08.053
I wrote the PIN in the passbook.

00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:10.313
It's everything I have.

00:06:11.153 --> 00:06:12.953
I know there isn't much money in there.

00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:18.523
But this is a designer brand,

00:06:19.893 --> 00:06:22.333
and this was a gift, but it's also from a designer brand.

00:06:23.093 --> 00:06:26.133
This one is limited edition, so you can sell it for a premium.

00:06:30.403 --> 00:06:31.843
This one is a designer brand too.

00:06:33.403 --> 00:06:34.543
Please take it all.

00:06:35.713 --> 00:06:37.713
This is all I have to give you.

00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:43.183
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:47.393
I know you mean well, Na Ra.

00:06:48.593 --> 00:06:50.023
And I know how much you've suffered.

00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:53.493
But your mother...

00:06:54.893 --> 00:06:56.063
I can't forgive her.

00:06:57.403 --> 00:06:59.533
She could have saved my father.

00:07:04.003 --> 00:07:06.303
I can't accept this, so take it back.

00:07:09.973 --> 00:07:11.983
You've been tormented by this for over 20 years,

00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:15.253
so go get some help for your trauma.

00:07:17.223 --> 00:07:18.423
I don't blame you, Na Ra.

00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:23.423
Take these back.

00:07:25.663 --> 00:07:26.793
I'm sorry.

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:29.593
Na Ra!

00:07:42.173 --> 00:07:43.813
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:45.413
Don't you know how to knock?

00:07:49.283 --> 00:07:50.353
It belongs to Hwang Na Ra.

00:07:51.623 --> 00:07:54.293
I guess there's at least one sane person in that family.

00:07:55.653 --> 00:07:59.223
She might be immature and a bit thoughtless,

00:07:59.723 --> 00:08:01.533
but unlike you or your mother,

00:08:01.763 --> 00:08:04.033
she has a conscience and a sense of morality.

00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:07.733
She's certainly a better person than you.

00:08:08.773 --> 00:08:11.473
At least she knows what it means to be a decent human being.

00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:14.113
You should learn from your sister.

00:08:15.543 --> 00:08:17.543
Did you run your mouth to Jae In about all this?

00:08:18.943 --> 00:08:20.283
About my family's business?

00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:25.053
With all the news about it, it'd be weirder if she didn't know.

00:08:25.623 --> 00:08:26.823
Right.

00:08:27.493 --> 00:08:31.963
But you're blocking the news, so I guess she could stay ignorant.

00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:33.893
What I mean is,

00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:37.563
did you exaggerate things, play the victim,

00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:40.063
and feed her a bunch of nonsense?

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:48.443
Didn't you hear me?

00:09:20.473 --> 00:09:22.813
Well, you got here first,

00:09:22.873 --> 00:09:24.483
so, you know, "First come, first served."

00:09:25.543 --> 00:09:27.213
I guess I should move then, right?

00:09:27.613 --> 00:09:28.613
And...

00:09:29.183 --> 00:09:30.783
you don't have to feel awkward.

00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:33.383
Besides, it's not like anything's going to change.

00:09:34.153 --> 00:09:36.353
That's what I think.

00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:38.523
Take your time with your drink.

00:09:39.163 --> 00:09:40.163
Take your time.

00:09:40.593 --> 00:09:41.593
Excuse me.

00:09:49.733 --> 00:09:50.743
No, wait...

00:10:02.653 --> 00:10:03.783
Go away. I'm not buying anything.

00:10:07.953 --> 00:10:09.953
How could it all have been a lie?

00:10:10.493 --> 00:10:11.993
All my hard-earned money is gone.

00:10:12.323 --> 00:10:14.993
Fine. No one's going to turn down money.

00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:16.393
I can let that slide.

00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:17.963
But...

00:10:18.303 --> 00:10:20.063
you're going to play with my heart?

00:10:21.573 --> 00:10:23.203
That's the worst crime of all.

00:10:23.673 --> 00:10:24.673
You hear me?

00:10:26.503 --> 00:10:27.573
You jerk.

00:10:28.013 --> 00:10:29.313
You absolute monster!

00:10:30.273 --> 00:10:32.183
Say something! I said, say something!

00:10:32.843 --> 00:10:34.313
Did you ever love me at all?

00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:38.683
Save the drunken rant for home.

00:10:39.953 --> 00:10:41.293
Stay out of it. You two broke up.

00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:43.493
What does my love life have to do with you?

00:10:45.093 --> 00:10:46.223
Who says we broke up?

00:10:47.533 --> 00:10:50.093
I'm the only one he loves.

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:52.633
He has very high standards.

00:10:53.063 --> 00:10:54.073
You really think...

00:10:54.673 --> 00:10:56.903
he'd leave me for you?

00:10:58.403 --> 00:10:59.473
But you said you two broke up.

00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:02.613
Was that just another lie to trick me?

00:11:04.383 --> 00:11:06.843
And I'm not at all sorry to say...

00:11:07.513 --> 00:11:09.413
that I never had feelings for you,

00:11:10.113 --> 00:11:12.853
not even once, not for a single second.

00:11:15.353 --> 00:11:18.923
- Jung Oh Seong! - If anything, when I met you,

00:11:19.193 --> 00:11:21.793
I was so creeped out, I had to scrub my hands raw afterward.

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:23.933
How could you...

00:11:24.863 --> 00:11:26.433
say something so cruel...

00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:29.233
so nonchalantly?

00:11:29.933 --> 00:11:31.643
I can say much worse.

00:11:32.003 --> 00:11:35.273
If you'd feel better being arrested for obstruction of business,

00:11:35.543 --> 00:11:37.113
I can certainly arrange that.

00:12:06.073 --> 00:12:08.573
He was the first man since your father.

00:12:10.113 --> 00:12:13.643
My heart raced just by being near him.

00:12:14.283 --> 00:12:16.313
Six million dollars? It wasn't a big deal.

00:12:18.323 --> 00:12:19.583
I would've given him...

00:12:20.083 --> 00:12:22.393
anything and everything.

00:12:24.123 --> 00:12:27.363
What am I going to do? How could he do this to me?

00:12:29.293 --> 00:12:30.293
Six million dollars? What do you mean?

00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:35.073
Are you saying the man who made your heart race is Patrick?

00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:38.443
Kim Do Yun's uncle?

00:12:38.743 --> 00:12:40.143
Do you mean CEO Jung Oh Seong?

00:12:44.813 --> 00:12:46.743
Well, you see...

00:12:49.513 --> 00:12:50.923
The heart is a funny thing.

00:12:52.323 --> 00:12:53.683
It doesn't care about age or nationality.

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.423
It just brings people together.

00:12:56.823 --> 00:12:58.263
Are you out of your mind?

00:12:59.993 --> 00:13:01.993
He's the last person you should be falling for.

00:13:03.363 --> 00:13:05.333
That man is the CEO of DH Holdings.

00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:06.863
He's my enemy!

00:13:07.873 --> 00:13:10.433
How was I supposed to know?

00:13:12.403 --> 00:13:15.543
At first, I just figured he was some guy from the chicken shop.

00:13:16.343 --> 00:13:17.613
I didn't know about this whole company business...

00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:20.243
Who knew it would end up like this?

00:13:20.343 --> 00:13:23.753
Did you ever think you'd be punished for embezzling insurance money?

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:26.253
Once you found out who CEO Jung Oh Seong really was,

00:13:26.423 --> 00:13:29.153
you should've got over him sooner. Didn't that ever cross your mind?

00:13:29.723 --> 00:13:32.063
The outcome was obvious from the start.

00:13:33.023 --> 00:13:35.093
Use your head for once. Please just think.

00:13:35.963 --> 00:13:39.003
Fine. So I'm thoughtless and ignorant.

00:13:39.003 --> 00:13:41.403
Yes. I'd have to agree.

00:13:43.003 --> 00:13:45.103
Because of what you did in the past,

00:13:45.443 --> 00:13:47.473
it's draining the life out of me every day.

00:13:48.313 --> 00:13:51.143
Although I'm not legally responsible for what you did,

00:13:51.483 --> 00:13:54.043
people are demanding the 'ethically and morally corrupt' chair resign.

00:13:54.513 --> 00:13:56.313
The company is being flooded with complaints.

00:13:57.113 --> 00:13:58.423
Please get a grip.

00:13:59.083 --> 00:14:01.653
You're not the one who wants to cry.

00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:02.823
I am!

00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:11.863
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:14:18.903 --> 00:14:21.473
Why did you want to meet out here instead of at the office?

00:14:26.113 --> 00:14:27.113
It's about Catherine.

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:30.383
I want to know why you're looking for Catherine.

00:14:35.893 --> 00:14:38.493
I'm guessing it has something to do with Kang Se Ri.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:41.593
I'd like to know too.

00:14:42.493 --> 00:14:43.493
Will you tell me?

00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:54.313
While trying to expose corruption at Catherine's H and K Company,

00:14:55.543 --> 00:14:57.913
your sister was killed.

00:15:00.383 --> 00:15:02.483
And she was also framed for having an affair with Hwang Gi Chan.

00:15:03.313 --> 00:15:04.423
That's right.

00:15:05.523 --> 00:15:07.593
That was why I was trying to find out who Catherine is.

00:15:16.063 --> 00:15:18.103
You must have been through so much.

00:15:20.163 --> 00:15:23.233
They were the two people I loved and trusted the most,

00:15:24.743 --> 00:15:27.003
so the word "betrayal" doesn't even begin to cover it.

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:32.013
But it's not just about me.

00:15:32.913 --> 00:15:35.283
Many other people were victims of their evil deeds.

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:38.683
It's tragic enough that they died,

00:15:40.053 --> 00:15:41.823
but I want to help them finally rest in peace.

00:15:43.093 --> 00:15:44.093
How?

00:15:45.123 --> 00:15:46.223
Kang Se Ri and Hwang Gi Chan.

00:15:47.123 --> 00:15:48.863
We have to bring them both down.

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:52.433
By exposing every single one of their crimes to the world,

00:15:53.533 --> 00:15:55.233
my ultimate goal is to see them ruined.

00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:00.543
All right.

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:02.773
Then,

00:16:03.513 --> 00:16:04.913
let me join you.

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:09.283
May I ask why?

00:16:10.683 --> 00:16:12.083
Is it because she stole your sister's name?

00:16:12.483 --> 00:16:13.753
That's part of it.

00:16:15.223 --> 00:16:17.823
She stole my sister's name and disgraced it.

00:16:21.893 --> 00:16:23.493
And you were right, Jae In.

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:29.033
She tried to kill me.

00:16:35.773 --> 00:16:36.843
(Sleeping Medication)

00:16:40.283 --> 00:16:42.583
I wonder whose fault it is that I can't sleep lately.

00:16:53.963 --> 00:16:54.963
Sleeping pills?

00:16:55.293 --> 00:16:56.463
Yes.

00:16:56.663 --> 00:16:59.063
She might have insomnia like she says,

00:16:59.903 --> 00:17:01.033
but something feels off.

00:17:01.533 --> 00:17:03.433
It looked like a very large dose.

00:17:04.203 --> 00:17:06.573
Be careful, just in case.

00:17:07.303 --> 00:17:10.243
- What? - The one Kang Se Ri fears most,

00:17:10.973 --> 00:17:12.583
besides me and Do Yun,

00:17:13.213 --> 00:17:14.853
is probably you.

00:17:15.553 --> 00:17:17.313
She knows you know who Catherine is,

00:17:17.483 --> 00:17:19.283
and she must be nervous about you living in the same house.

00:17:20.483 --> 00:17:22.053
You can't be too careful.

00:17:22.993 --> 00:17:23.993
Be careful.

00:17:24.963 --> 00:17:26.323
I had a feeling she might try something,

00:17:27.223 --> 00:17:28.933
but I never thought she'd actually go that far.

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:33.633
Just because he knew Catherine and dated her in the past,

00:17:34.103 --> 00:17:35.333
is that a reason to kill him?

00:17:36.503 --> 00:17:38.143
She's completely out of her mind.

00:17:38.403 --> 00:17:40.873
She has another reason to want me dead.

00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:47.683
It's because of Ji Ho.

00:17:52.383 --> 00:17:53.453
Hwang Ji Ho.

00:17:55.393 --> 00:17:57.123
He's not Chairman Hwang's son.

00:17:59.093 --> 00:18:00.223
He's my son.

00:18:05.733 --> 00:18:07.203
When did you find out?

00:18:08.533 --> 00:18:10.033
After I came to Korea this time.

00:18:11.473 --> 00:18:13.473
If I hadn't come here, I never would've known.

00:18:15.613 --> 00:18:17.783
Still, I don't see it as a tragedy, but a blessing.

00:18:18.883 --> 00:18:20.383
Because at least I know now.

00:18:31.263 --> 00:18:33.193
Go on ahead. I have something else to do.

00:18:35.993 --> 00:18:37.093
Yes, hello?

00:18:40.303 --> 00:18:43.333
Isn't it dangerous for you to keep staying in that house?

00:18:45.173 --> 00:18:47.873
It might be safer to stay in plain sight.

00:18:48.443 --> 00:18:50.273
And this way, I can find out what Se Ri plots.

00:18:52.713 --> 00:18:56.453
I moved in to watch over Ji Ho, even for just a bit,

00:18:56.913 --> 00:18:59.823
but that house is a terrible place for him.

00:19:00.783 --> 00:19:02.723
So I'm going to take him to the U.S.

00:19:04.193 --> 00:19:05.363
Does Se Ri know?

00:19:06.163 --> 00:19:09.263
I told her. The chairman doesn't know yet,

00:19:09.363 --> 00:19:10.493
but I'm planning to tell him soon.

00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:30.283
See?

00:19:31.423 --> 00:19:33.153
I told you something was up with those two.

00:19:49.573 --> 00:19:50.803
Excuse me.

00:19:51.303 --> 00:19:52.443
I'm not interrupting, am I?

00:19:53.043 --> 00:19:54.073
Not at all.

00:19:54.403 --> 00:19:55.773
What can I do for you?

00:19:56.413 --> 00:20:00.783
I noticed your gallery lists work by promising new artists.

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:02.313
Would it be possible to meet with them?

00:20:03.283 --> 00:20:06.123
Of course. I'll let my mother know.

00:20:06.783 --> 00:20:07.823
Understood.

00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:11.363
How's the collaboration with Designer L coming along?

00:20:13.693 --> 00:20:15.593
You seem very interested in me.

00:20:16.463 --> 00:20:20.603
Jae In has a great eye for art, so we're on the same wavelength.

00:20:20.963 --> 00:20:23.333
Things are moving more smoothly than expected.

00:20:25.043 --> 00:20:26.403
You call her Jae In,

00:20:26.943 --> 00:20:28.613
not Designer L.

00:20:29.913 --> 00:20:33.743
Well, her name is Jae In, so that's what I call her.

00:20:34.513 --> 00:20:36.913
So you're interested in Jae In?

00:20:37.413 --> 00:20:38.923
You catch on quick.

00:20:39.453 --> 00:20:42.723
Jae In is a very charming woman.

00:20:43.123 --> 00:20:44.453
Of course, I'm interested.

00:20:44.863 --> 00:20:46.823
I'm interested in her.

00:20:47.623 --> 00:20:49.433
You know she's divorced, right?

00:20:50.093 --> 00:20:53.403
She's single now, and I'm single. That's all that matters.

00:20:53.663 --> 00:20:57.373
I'm not one to dwell on the past. What matters is the here and now,

00:20:57.373 --> 00:20:59.743
and how I feel.

00:21:06.343 --> 00:21:08.983
Banana milk today. You're not going to toast with me?

00:21:09.753 --> 00:21:12.353
All right. I'll have one of those, too.

00:21:12.423 --> 00:21:13.523
I'll toast with you.

00:21:14.083 --> 00:21:16.693
Do you like banana milk? There's chocolate milk too.

00:21:29.933 --> 00:21:31.133
Here's your coffee.

00:21:34.913 --> 00:21:36.773
Ma'am, where are you off to?

00:21:37.413 --> 00:21:39.713
Yes, I just have somewhere to be.

00:21:40.243 --> 00:21:41.453
Would you like a ride?

00:21:41.813 --> 00:21:42.813
No, it's okay.

00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:45.823
Don't worry, everyone.

00:21:46.153 --> 00:21:47.353
I'll be back soon.

00:21:53.093 --> 00:21:56.693
She seems so fragile lately.

00:21:57.633 --> 00:21:58.963
She's always been a gentle soul.

00:22:00.133 --> 00:22:02.473
She was just very good at hiding it.

00:22:08.173 --> 00:22:09.343
Patrick.

00:22:16.383 --> 00:22:18.383
Let's talk, man to man.

00:22:19.123 --> 00:22:20.983
I have to step out for work, so wait until my return.

00:22:27.323 --> 00:22:28.563
And don't even think about running off.

00:22:29.263 --> 00:22:30.293
I mean it.

00:22:31.363 --> 00:22:32.363
Fine.

(Designer Kang Jae In)

00:22:46.313 --> 00:22:47.983
Looks like Director Kim Do Yun isn't here.

00:22:48.753 --> 00:22:51.253
He said he needed a file, so I came to drop it off.

00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:52.753
Just leave it on his desk.

00:22:57.223 --> 00:22:58.563
I don't see Tae Ho either.

00:22:59.093 --> 00:23:00.163
Where did he go?

00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:04.063
If you're so curious, call and ask him yourself.

00:23:08.233 --> 00:23:09.233
Right.

00:23:09.733 --> 00:23:11.943
You really have a knack for wrapping men around your finger.

00:23:12.643 --> 00:23:14.573
Maybe I should learn a trick or two from you.

00:23:15.413 --> 00:23:19.213
You went after Director Kim, then you hit on Gi Chan,

00:23:19.483 --> 00:23:20.813
and now it's Lee Tae Ho?

00:23:22.053 --> 00:23:25.583
You just have to try your luck with every man you see, don't you?

00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:28.153
Se Ri.

00:23:28.693 --> 00:23:30.923
You know, the more I see Tae Ho,

00:23:31.023 --> 00:23:33.823
the more he looks like someone, you know.

00:23:35.563 --> 00:23:39.033
He looks a lot like Ji Ho, don't you think?

00:23:40.203 --> 00:23:42.073
Even more than his own father, Hwang Gi Chan.

00:23:43.533 --> 00:23:45.503
How could Ji Ho possibly look like Tae Ho?

00:23:45.873 --> 00:23:48.443
Gi Chan is his father. Don't be ridiculous.

00:23:48.943 --> 00:23:52.683
You think you can frame me, but you think I'll fall for it?

00:23:52.913 --> 00:23:54.043
Don't make me laugh.

00:23:54.413 --> 00:23:56.583
Gi Chan won't fall for a cheap trick like that either.

00:23:57.113 --> 00:23:59.753
Fine. Believe what you want.

00:24:00.353 --> 00:24:01.993
Don't be so defensive.

00:24:02.323 --> 00:24:05.493
The way you're reacting just makes it sound true.

00:24:06.363 --> 00:24:08.333
If you dropped off the files, go back to work.

I have to step out for a meeting. Could you leave now?

00:24:11.833 --> 00:24:13.633
If you spout that nonsense one more time,

00:24:14.233 --> 00:24:16.273
I might just sue you for defamation.

00:24:16.673 --> 00:24:17.673
Mark my words.

00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:30.183
I wonder how Gi Chan will react when he finds out, Se Ri.

How have you been feeling? Are you in any pain?

00:24:37.193 --> 00:24:39.093
I came here to talk to you about something.

00:24:39.693 --> 00:24:40.993
You don't need to worry about me.

00:24:42.233 --> 00:24:44.033
Okay, go ahead.

00:24:44.633 --> 00:24:45.833
It's about Seung Woo.

00:24:46.863 --> 00:24:48.303
Please register him as your son.

00:24:51.303 --> 00:24:53.143
Seung Woo now knows that I'm sick.

00:24:54.173 --> 00:24:56.743
I think that's why he's trying so hard to stay by my side,

00:24:57.473 --> 00:24:59.383
but there's no reason for him to.

00:24:59.913 --> 00:25:00.913
Ja Young,

00:25:01.313 --> 00:25:03.583
Seung Woo thinks of you as his mother.

00:25:04.483 --> 00:25:07.553
He doesn't have any ulterior motives for being with you.

00:25:07.653 --> 00:25:08.853
Exactly.

00:25:09.953 --> 00:25:11.723
After he found out the truth about his birth,

00:25:12.163 --> 00:25:14.723
I think he can't help but feel guilty.

00:25:15.863 --> 00:25:18.703
But Seung Woo has no reason to feel guilty.

00:25:19.463 --> 00:25:22.403
If anything, he's the one we should feel sorry for.

00:25:24.433 --> 00:25:28.043
I wasn't able to give him the love he deserved.

00:25:29.443 --> 00:25:31.543
So what right do I have to be his mother?

00:25:32.243 --> 00:25:33.683
You should legally adopt him.

00:25:34.683 --> 00:25:38.323
I was being shortsighted when I said I'd register Seung Woo as my son.

00:25:38.723 --> 00:25:40.823
Please don't dwell on it.

00:25:41.083 --> 00:25:42.653
You're Seung Woo's mother.

00:25:43.523 --> 00:25:46.363
Just think about Seung Woo and be selfish for once.

00:25:46.963 --> 00:25:48.893
That's what's best for him.

00:25:50.333 --> 00:25:52.933
Don't worry about me. Please just do it.

00:25:53.463 --> 00:25:54.533
It's the right thing to do.

00:26:00.303 --> 00:26:01.713
I've said my piece.

00:26:02.273 --> 00:26:03.373
I'll be on my way now.

00:26:38.283 --> 00:26:39.313
Wait.

00:26:40.683 --> 00:26:41.983
We need to talk.

00:26:45.753 --> 00:26:47.753
What do you want that you had to drag me all the way out here?

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:51.523
I have nothing more to say to you.

00:26:52.623 --> 00:26:54.963
Have you ever once accepted me as your son-in-law?

00:26:56.633 --> 00:26:57.693
What?

00:26:57.863 --> 00:26:59.103
I want to know if you ever accepted me...

00:26:59.733 --> 00:27:00.833
as your son-in-law,

00:27:01.363 --> 00:27:04.033
as the man married to Jae In,

00:27:04.943 --> 00:27:06.043
even just once.

00:27:08.573 --> 00:27:11.073
Why do you want to know that now of all times?

00:27:14.183 --> 00:27:15.283
I was just curious.

00:27:19.553 --> 00:27:23.493
Why do you think I let Jae In marry you?

00:27:25.463 --> 00:27:26.623
I don't know.

00:27:27.023 --> 00:27:29.363
Think back to the first time you met me.

00:27:30.133 --> 00:27:31.233
That's my answer.

00:27:40.673 --> 00:27:44.613
Ma'am, how much do you think Jae In is worth?

00:27:45.013 --> 00:27:47.043
A child is priceless.

00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:48.813
I feel the same way.

00:27:49.253 --> 00:27:52.453
My parents always put their children's happiness first.

00:27:53.153 --> 00:27:54.753
I want to show Jae In...

00:27:56.223 --> 00:27:57.623
that a world like that exists for her too.

00:27:58.393 --> 00:28:00.393
I approved of the marriage because you said that.

00:28:01.423 --> 00:28:02.493
I looked past everything else,

00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:05.633
and only thought of my daughter Jae In's happiness.

00:28:25.483 --> 00:28:27.223
I can't believe you actually waited instead of running away.

00:28:27.383 --> 00:28:29.353
(DH Holdings)

00:28:29.423 --> 00:28:31.223
I wouldn't call it "running away."

00:28:32.023 --> 00:28:36.463
Let's say I gave you time to soften the blow, as a courtesy.

00:28:37.393 --> 00:28:39.433
That's how I'd prefer you put it.

00:28:41.233 --> 00:28:42.733
Now that sounds more like Patrick.

00:28:44.933 --> 00:28:45.943
Sorry about that.

00:28:46.943 --> 00:28:50.513
You said I seemed to have gained some wisdom with age.

00:28:50.813 --> 00:28:52.383
And not long after you complimented me,

00:28:53.643 --> 00:28:55.553
I acted like a complete fool, didn't I?

00:28:56.053 --> 00:28:57.053
I get it.

00:28:57.953 --> 00:28:59.123
As shocked as I was,

00:29:00.253 --> 00:29:03.193
you must have been even more shocked.

00:29:05.293 --> 00:29:08.493
I know all too well what a terrible father I am,

00:29:09.393 --> 00:29:10.493
so I guess I got scared.

00:29:12.563 --> 00:29:14.063
I didn't even know I had a son.

00:29:14.663 --> 00:29:16.033
I didn't get to see you grow up.

00:29:16.733 --> 00:29:18.943
And I completely failed in my duty to raise you.

00:29:19.473 --> 00:29:21.003
Then I show up, claiming to be your father.

00:29:22.573 --> 00:29:24.613
How absurd and pathetic must that have seemed?

00:29:26.383 --> 00:29:28.483
I could say that I didn't know or that I was shocked too.

00:29:29.053 --> 00:29:30.483
But that's just my side of the story.

00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:34.453
It's obviously different from a son's perspective.

00:29:36.693 --> 00:29:39.123
So go ahead, you can punch me.

00:29:41.193 --> 00:29:43.063
Why would I punch you?

00:29:45.033 --> 00:29:47.063
"Where have you been all my life?"

00:29:47.733 --> 00:29:49.233
"You think being my dad now makes it all okay?"

00:29:50.773 --> 00:29:54.043
Seung Woo, if you're angry or feel like you've been wronged,

00:29:54.803 --> 00:29:56.243
just hit me and let it all out.

00:29:59.143 --> 00:30:00.313
I'll admit I was surprised.

00:30:00.783 --> 00:30:03.453
But I'm also pretty intrigued and even excited.

00:30:04.983 --> 00:30:06.483
That the man my aunt was with...

00:30:07.383 --> 00:30:09.323
was you, Patrick, and not just anyone.

00:30:10.793 --> 00:30:13.963
And to think that you're the one who brought me into this world,

00:30:16.193 --> 00:30:17.293
I'm honestly relieved.

00:30:28.303 --> 00:30:29.673
Man to man, with feeling!

00:30:30.373 --> 00:30:31.673
Can I give you a hug?

00:30:40.853 --> 00:30:41.853
Thank you...

00:30:42.793 --> 00:30:44.023
for being my son.

00:30:47.023 --> 00:30:48.093
Me too.

00:30:49.293 --> 00:30:50.363
I'm grateful too.

00:31:00.543 --> 00:31:03.913
Did Mom really suggest you legally adopt Seung Woo?

00:31:05.513 --> 00:31:07.683
Seung Woo knows she's sick,

00:31:08.313 --> 00:31:09.613
and she feels bad he's taking care of her.

00:31:11.383 --> 00:31:13.923
She thinks he's only looking after her out of guilt.

00:31:15.523 --> 00:31:19.063
She doesn't want Seung Woo to feel that way.

00:31:19.323 --> 00:31:21.623
I think that's why she brought up the adoption for his sake.

00:31:23.793 --> 00:31:27.363
I have no intention of changing Seung Woo's legal status now.

00:31:28.573 --> 00:31:29.673
What do you think?

00:31:31.773 --> 00:31:33.543
I understand where Mom's coming from,

00:31:33.903 --> 00:31:36.143
but my feelings on the matter haven't changed.

00:31:37.013 --> 00:31:38.913
It should be Seung Woo's decision.

00:31:39.213 --> 00:31:40.883
And I want to respect whatever he chooses.

00:31:43.213 --> 00:31:45.013
Seung Woo considers her his mother,

00:31:45.523 --> 00:31:47.953
and wants to care for her as her son until the very end.

00:31:48.923 --> 00:31:51.393
And I respect his wishes.

00:31:53.763 --> 00:31:55.123
Thank you.

00:31:58.863 --> 00:32:01.363
Are these really the best specs available for our company laptops?

00:32:02.573 --> 00:32:05.003
Is there a rule that only designers get to use the expensive ones?

00:32:05.473 --> 00:32:07.373
I have to run a lot of programs too.

00:32:55.393 --> 00:32:58.123
I knew I saw that correctly.

00:32:58.993 --> 00:33:00.963
She was logging into Catherine's email account.

00:33:17.713 --> 00:33:18.713
Found it!

00:33:20.843 --> 00:33:22.753
The double contract of H and K Company.

00:34:03.993 --> 00:34:07.723
(Queen's House)

00:34:07.793 --> 00:34:10.493
Did I hear that right? What did you just say?

00:34:10.893 --> 00:34:12.603
Give me my money! It's mine!

00:34:13.163 --> 00:34:15.603
Just because I skimmed a little off your husband's insurance payout,

00:34:15.933 --> 00:34:17.803
doesn't mean you can shake me down for six million dollars.

00:34:18.303 --> 00:34:20.743
We have an urgent bank loan payment due.

00:34:20.873 --> 00:34:23.143
Can't we just ask the bank for an extension?

00:34:23.313 --> 00:34:24.343
Well...

00:34:25.683 --> 00:34:28.713
- The bank denied our request. - Cash is king!

00:34:28.883 --> 00:34:32.153
Mom, why does it always have to be about money with you?

00:34:33.253 --> 00:34:35.823
Happiness, love, success, relationships,

00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:37.393
and everything is about money to you.

00:34:37.653 --> 00:34:40.593
Hey, come play with me. I'm bored.
