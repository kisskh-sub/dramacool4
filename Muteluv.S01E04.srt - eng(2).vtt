00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.976
We only spend a few days together.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.170
How can I make him fall for me?

00:00:02.192 --> 00:00:04.150
It happens all the time in dramas.

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:06.472
Did you have fun spending time together?

00:00:06.496 --> 00:00:07.808
I like being with you.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.544
Mawin is not my friend.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.656
He’s my rival.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.512
You are not alone, Mawin.

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:14.608
Where the hell is he?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.136
Mangpor was right.

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:19.296
A guy like me should be alone.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.896
I did all these
because I only see you as my schoolmate.

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:22.936
Does he like me that much?

00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:25.700
THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.416
Why don’t you sit at the desk and study?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.624
I want to change the environment.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.920
Are you feeling shy because we kissed?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.776
Why are you mentioning it?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.976
Why not?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.336
We did kiss.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.848
You are smart.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.056
Smart?

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:08.584
Your question is so damn hard.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.664
But you solved it.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.840
If you have a bit more confidence,

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:16.780
you can beat Mangpor.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.208
Stop overpraising me like Benz does.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.112
I’m not.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.032
Math is logic.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520
If you understand it, you can solve it.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.880
And you understand it.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.840
Do you really want to go?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.136
Go where?

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.080
Go study abroad.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.744
I don’t know.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.784
I’ll think about it when I get the scholarship.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.752
What if?

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:52.928
If I submit a blank answer sheet tomorrow,

00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:54.280
you surely will win the scholarship.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.984
That’s not funny, Mawin.

00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:02.900
Don’t do that ever.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.912
I won’t do it.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.896
No matter how much I like you,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.768
I won’t submit a blank answer sheet for you.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.144
Then stop bothering me.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.112
I want to focus on studying.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.656
Then I’ll go to bed.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.080
Stay with me.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.144
[Tomorrow is the exam day.
But I don’t feel stressed at all.]

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:51.112
[Thank you for listening to me all this time.]

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.712
[You should go to bed.]

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.000
[Tomorrow, you will get what you want.]

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.520
[Tomorrow, you will get what you want.]

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.544
Shit.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.784
Mawin, wake up.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.280
Were you in that hurry
and forgot to wake me up?

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.400
You are almost late for the exam.

00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:50.632
Give me your phone.

00:04:51.464 --> 00:04:53.460
Anantachai, your seat is in the front row.

00:04:53.488 --> 00:04:54.200
Hurry up.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.384
Stop looking around.

00:05:05.408 --> 00:05:07.208
I’m serious today.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.776
I’ll remind you again.

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:11.888
If you break any rules,
you’ll be eliminated immediately.

00:05:11.928 --> 00:05:14.352
The exam consists of ten questions.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.936
If you need more paper for calculations,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.976
You have 4.5 hours to finish the exam.

00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:25.240
Spend the time well.

00:05:25.872 --> 00:05:27.870
If you have no other questions,

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.216
you can start now.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.120
I feel like I’m going to die.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.432
My soul has left my body.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.256
Why didn’t Mawin attend the exam?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.992
He’s probably still in the exam room.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.448
No.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.320
I mean, why didn’t he come to the exam room?

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.888
What do you mean he wasn’t in the exam room?

00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:48.890
He left our room before me.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.528
He really wasn’t in the exam room.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.080
His seat was next to mine.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.008
But he wasn’t there.

00:07:05.032 --> 00:07:06.848
The teachers were looking for him everywhere.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.648
What’s up, Benz?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.040
(Why don’t you read my messages?)

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.264
(I got big news.)

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.736
I’m busy. I’ll call you back.

00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:45.680
(No, you need to listen to me.)

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.848
(Seer TK, whom you’ve been chatting with,
is Mawin, your roommate at the camp.)

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.952
[Tomorrow, you will get what you want.]

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.056
Is this what you chose?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.208
No one can reach him even now?

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.608
The teachers checked the CCTV.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.368
He left the hotel when we were taking the exam.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.240
What’s wrong with him?

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.296
He seemed fine yesterday.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.408
Err, you didn’t fight with him, right?

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.736
We’ve got to go.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.152
Mr. Mhee. Mr. Err. Get home safely.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.184
Let’s meet up for a meal sometimes.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.216
Come on.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.448
See you.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.184
How was the exam?

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.792
It was so hard. I didn’t do well.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.800
Hey! Err, my friend.

00:09:47.832 --> 00:09:48.808
Stop playing around.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.880
I’m not in the mood.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.192
How was the camp?

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.472
Mhee told me that
you were one of the aces in the camp.

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:18.856
See? My friend is the best.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.776
That guy is Mawin.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.976
Is he crazy?

00:10:24.016 --> 00:10:25.760
Why did he pretend to be the fortune teller?

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.448
People consulted him on their problems.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.408
That’s why everyone is scolding him.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.424
It serves him right.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.472
Suck it.

00:10:32.488 --> 00:10:33.240
Yeah.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.752
Err.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.256
Everyone in the school is talking about Mawin.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.272
(Did you see posts
of the football team members on Facebook?)

00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:55.488
(They all scolded him.)

00:10:55.512 --> 00:10:56.824
(If I were them, I would do it too.)

00:10:56.848 --> 00:10:59.128
(He did hurt their feelings.)

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.512
(But at least, he didn’t charge them any fees
for the advice.)

00:11:03.528 --> 00:11:06.128
(Otherwise, things could be worse.)

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.296
Do you still have Seer TK’s contact?

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.976
I want to contact him.

00:11:12.952 --> 00:11:14.950
Just leave him alone.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.608
I feel bad for him.

00:11:16.648 --> 00:11:17.904
Everyone is scolding him.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.328
I just want to tease him.

00:11:20.352 --> 00:11:22.768
I think he no longer uses the account.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.688
What’s up with you?

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.248
Before you went to the camp,
you two just didn’t get along.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.328
But when you came back from the camp,

00:11:34.376 --> 00:11:35.816
it looks like you hate each other.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.784
Mhee told me that he’s not a bad person.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.656
We need to talk.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.728
Don’t you feel anything?

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.088
After hearing other students talk about you.

00:12:34.544 --> 00:12:36.540
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.640
Just say what you are thinking.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.216
Will they listen to me if I tell them?

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.360
I also have a right to be mad at you, right?

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.880
Yes.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.496
Aren’t you going to explain yourself?

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.000
What you think, how you feel.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.320
What you think, how you feel.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.304
Aren’t you going to tell me?

00:13:06.632 --> 00:13:08.630
I’ve told you everything, Err.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.096
What I think, how I feel.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.088
I’ve told you everything.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.344
You think it’s enough?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.832
To make up for what I feel right now.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.840
You lied to me.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.840
Do you think I’m stupid?

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.200
Do you think you can fool me?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.728
Do you think you’re smarter than me?

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.400
You know that’s not what I think.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.536
Then why did you do that?

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.856
You skipped the exam.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.128
Why the hell did you do that, Mawin?

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.160
Did you want to be a hero?

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.128
If you skipped the exam,
I would have a higher chance of getting it.

00:13:43.152 --> 00:13:43.810
Is that what you think?

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.632
What kind of friend are you?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.536
Are you regretting being my friend?

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.368
Then you can do whatever you want.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.136
(We have only one month left
before graduating from high school.)

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.392
(We both went back to our normal lives.)

00:14:41.032 --> 00:14:42.896
(As if nothing happened at the camp.)

00:14:44.304 --> 00:14:45.456
Why? Is it not good?

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.752
You know it, right?

00:14:47.768 --> 00:14:48.776
FINAL EXAM OF 2ND SEMESTER OF 2024

00:14:48.808 --> 00:14:50.780
(We are just two horses
competing in the same race.)

00:14:51.416 --> 00:14:53.420
(We just need to do our job.)

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.000
We have spent the last six years together
at this school.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.696
We have spent the last six years together
at this school.

00:15:05.728 --> 00:15:08.472
(We completely live separate lives.)

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.536
(I don’t know what’s going on in his life.)

00:15:16.664 --> 00:15:17.968
We are going to college.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.064
Aren’t you happy?

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:22.088
We graduated from high school.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.872
(I don’t want to know either.)

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.432
What are you going to study?

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.288
You will go to the same college?

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:31.184
(Does the scholarship result come out?)

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.008
(What’s wrong with your internet, Mhee?)

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.240
(We can’t connect to the internet.)

00:15:34.272 --> 00:15:36.240
(Err, refresh the page.)

00:15:36.272 --> 00:15:37.376
(Shit, the result is out.)

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.248
(What? Is it out?)

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.184
Damn!

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.020
THE WINNER IS ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.368
I got it.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.080
Well done.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.968
Good job.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.776
Whose son is this?

00:15:53.816 --> 00:15:54.744
I’m your son.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.048
(I need to move on.)

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.000
Yay!

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.912
Yay!

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.832
Let’s go celebrate at my house next time.

00:16:04.864 --> 00:16:06.640
I’ll steal a bottle of my dad’s booze.

00:16:06.672 --> 00:16:07.784
He won’t notice it.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.104
Sure.

00:16:09.128 --> 00:16:10.528
How about the first week of next month?

00:16:10.568 --> 00:16:12.048
After my college admission is announced.

00:16:12.088 --> 00:16:14.816
Are you so confident that you will get in?

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.232
Hey!

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.304
Don’t underestimate me.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.336
I’m also a student in the gifted class.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.896
If you’re going to celebrate next month,
I can’t make it.

00:16:24.928 --> 00:16:27.064
Doesn’t your school start in August?

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.976
Why are you leaving so soon?

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.784
I need to take an English course first.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.968
I’m leaving at the end of this month.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.024
Why are you hurry to move to Boston?

00:16:34.064 --> 00:16:35.376
We only have two weeks left.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.168
My friend is a real deal.

00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:39.824
Only one student across the country is selected.

00:16:39.856 --> 00:16:41.296
But you got it.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.120
True.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.128
Who would have thought
that you could beat Mangpor?

00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:47.048
Unbelievable.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.584
Are you talking about the tough girl
you met the other day?

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.504
Mhee.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.160
Why did you meet up with Mangpor?

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.808
Mhee.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.624
Benz.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.680
You ruin my surprise.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.272
Give me your picture that I asked for.

00:17:07.296 --> 00:17:08.152
Here.

00:17:11.728 --> 00:17:12.344
What are you doing?

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.176
It fits perfectly.

00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:16.712
You two are unbelievable.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.440
One, two, three.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.400
Tada!

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.968
Mangpor and Ton came to Bangkok.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.488
They gave this to me.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.632
They worked so hard to make it.

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:30.160
They sent it across the country.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.016
Look.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.728
Only Mawin’s message is missing.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.064
No one has his address.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.424
We can’t ask the teachers for it
since it’s personal information.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.920
He doesn’t use any social media.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.304
I asked our classmates.

00:17:44.336 --> 00:17:46.768
After the school semester ended,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.770
no one can contact him.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.048
We don’t have his chat account.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.680
We only have Seer TK’s account.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.728
He doesn’t use the account anymore.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.368
But it still looks pretty. Look.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.976
I have something to tell you.

00:18:09.016 --> 00:18:11.864
No, I have a gossip to share with you.

00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:12.184
What is it?

00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:15.136
Ton was my roommate.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.944
I barely got any sleep.

00:18:16.968 --> 00:18:18.608
He cried every night.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.112
Because he missed his grandma and buffalo.

00:18:21.144 --> 00:18:22.128
Why?

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.648
He suddenly cried
because he missed his grandma.

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:26.064
I don’t know why.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.760
Hey.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.624
When will you finish packing?

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.680
I have another ten days before I leave.

00:18:44.704 --> 00:18:46.128
I’ll do it later.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.760
My other son is also following his dream.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:00.000
Do you think
getting the scholarship was his dream?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.288
Do you think
getting the scholarship was his dream?

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.752
It was his dream at the time.

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:06.968
But I still considered it his dream.

00:19:06.992 --> 00:19:11.432
Even now, he chose to open an online shop
after graduating.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:21.264
Have you wanted me or my brother
to be a smart researcher like Dad?

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.112
No matter how smart he was,

00:19:24.152 --> 00:19:26.912
he died when you were only 10.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.872
I’ve never had that kind of plan.

00:19:29.896 --> 00:19:32.330
You can do whatever you want.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.040
If I refuse to go to America,
aren’t you going to scold me?

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.488
Why would I scold you?

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.744
I just want to hold a celebratory party.

00:19:43.784 --> 00:19:46.728
Everyone tells me that I’m lucky.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.144
Both my sons are excellent students.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.120
Stay still.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.968
But you know this, right?

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.000
I feel proudest

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.208
I feel proudest

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.432
when I see you and your brother are happy.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.552
There.

00:20:09.568 --> 00:20:13.536
There it is, ingrown hair.

00:20:13.568 --> 00:20:14.976
Look.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.936
- What shampoo do you use?
- It hurts, Mom.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.480
Finish your packing.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:33.816
Clear tape.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.024
(Fate likes to play a joke on me.)

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.432
(When I thought
I was the smartest guy in the world,)

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.720
(I found out…)

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.824
(how clueless I am.)

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.712
(You probably find this letter
after finishing the exam.)

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.312
(That’s a good thing.)

00:21:40.336 --> 00:21:42.310
(So you can focus on the exam.)

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.904
(I’m not sure
how you will feel about my decision.)

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.112
(But I want to explain myself.)

00:21:47.152 --> 00:21:48.670
(I want you to understand me.)

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.312
Mawin is joining our class starting today.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.000
Please be nice to your new classmate.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.448
Please be nice to your new classmate.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.360
[Firstly, I’m Seer TK.]

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.592
[You know I don’t know how to make friends.]

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.784
Does anyone know the answer?

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.824
The new student.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.136
What is the answer?

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.824
68.

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:26.552
68.

00:22:28.496 --> 00:22:30.500
(No one wants to talk to me.)

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.832
(But you know what.)

00:22:32.864 --> 00:22:36.424
(Being left alone gives me a special power.)

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.688
(You can say that I’m being nosy.)

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:43.464
(But when I sit quietly,
I can hear other people clearly.)

00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:45.216
There’s only you and me this evening.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.048
Pam bails on us again.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:48.920
She said she’s sick.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.408
I guess she wants to study without us.

00:22:51.448 --> 00:22:54.336
She also got full scores
on the chemistry quiz last time.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:08.464
(For many problems,
all they need to do is talk to each other.)

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.320
It’s bad to watch him waste his talents.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.264
The principal is worried
about the school’s image.

00:23:14.792 --> 00:23:16.208
His grades are not good.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.448
(I don’t have the courage
to walk in and give them advice.)

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.504
(I’m afraid that they will tell me
to mind my own business.)

00:23:24.248 --> 00:23:26.250
[I want to be drafted into a football team.
What do I do?]

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.368
[Study hard and dress neatly.]

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.224
[What? I want to be on the football team.
They don’t care about my grades.]

00:23:32.256 --> 00:23:33.640
[Talk politely.]

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.248
(So I created the fortune teller’s account.)

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.672
(My advice has nothing to do
with fortune-telling.)

00:23:40.704 --> 00:23:44.760
(I only tell them what they need to do
based on the stories I heard.)

00:23:51.912 --> 00:23:53.910
You have gastritis, Pam?

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.264
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.208
If I didn’t go to the infirmary,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.680
I would never know you’re sick.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.000
Why did you go to the infirmary?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.312
Why did you go to the infirmary?

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.320
I went to get an herbal balm.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.064
Anyway.

00:24:04.112 --> 00:24:07.888
[My friend only cares about studying.
We are drifting apart.]

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.560
[Fix it with an herbal balm.]

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.448
Are you sick?

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.000
No, I just went there to get an herbal balm.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.640
Let’s try again.

00:24:26.752 --> 00:24:28.750
It hurts. Be careful with your serving.

00:24:28.768 --> 00:24:29.776
Fine.

00:24:31.552 --> 00:24:33.550
(I just wanted to help you.)

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.550
(I didn’t mean to lie to you.)

00:24:35.584 --> 00:24:37.128
What kind of answer is this?

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:43.304
He told you how to pick a good partner.

00:24:43.344 --> 00:24:44.856
How does that have anything to do with focus?

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.584
Hey, look there.

00:24:50.616 --> 00:24:51.776
Come on.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.576
Come on, Err.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.000
Hey.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.056
Hey.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.448
Do you want to be my partner
for the badminton test?

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.336
(But you misinterpreted my advice.)

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.296
(I had everything planned out.)

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:16.216
(But spending twelve days with you at the camp
was not a part of my plan.)

00:25:40.064 --> 00:25:44.296
(Who would have thought
you would interpret my advice in that way?)

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.728
(I only told you to be nice to people around you.)

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.496
(So you would have fun at the camp.)

00:25:49.544 --> 00:25:51.752
(I didn’t tell you to make me fall for you.)

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.200
(But you know it, right?)

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.000
(You barely need to do anything.)

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.368
(You barely need to do anything.)

00:26:00.408 --> 00:26:03.616
(I already fell for you in just a few days.)

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.736
(I like you.)

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.456
(Even though the advice said otherwise,
I would still fall for you.)

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.712
Stop it.

00:26:13.744 --> 00:26:14.424
You started it.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.152
(You’ll probably be mad at me
for skipping the exam.)

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.888
(You told me that we are only 18.)

00:26:34.928 --> 00:26:37.176
(There are plenty of things waiting for us to try.)

00:26:37.224 --> 00:26:40.040
(I don’t want to waste my time
on doing something I don’t want to do.)

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.792
(I didn’t do this for you or anyone else.)

00:26:43.824 --> 00:26:48.512
(I found what I like and want to do
because of you.)

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.816
(I’m sorry if this will upset you.)

00:26:50.848 --> 00:26:54.872
(I hope you will understand me,
and things will not change between us.)

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.736
(Because my feelings for you have not changed.)

00:27:11.472 --> 00:27:12.616
Dead, dead.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.424
Shit, I’m dead.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.288
The plant doesn’t give me any good energy.

00:27:54.008 --> 00:27:57.768
(Next is the news we need to talk about.)

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.000
(A young actor is caught having an affair.)

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.176
(A young actor is caught having an affair.)

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.896
(Pilapia are different from other fish, Jirat.)

00:28:05.928 --> 00:28:10.160
(In my hometown, we need monks to perform
a ritual before we build a pond for them.)

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.320
(When it’s time to switch classrooms,
my friends usually don’t wait for me, Tle.)

00:28:13.336 --> 00:28:14.512
(What should I do?)

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.872
(Does it make you feel lonely or what?)

00:28:16.896 --> 00:28:18.304
Do you remember this?

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.864
Wow!

00:28:24.888 --> 00:28:26.860
You look amazing.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.160
Thank you.

00:28:36.184 --> 00:28:38.928
What the…why do you look surprised?

00:28:38.952 --> 00:28:40.776
This is my everyday look.

00:28:40.808 --> 00:28:42.080
This is just my nightwear.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.120
Stop teasing me.

00:28:46.152 --> 00:28:48.728
Welcome to the class, students.

00:28:48.768 --> 00:28:51.344
This is a conversational class.

00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:56.280
This class will be like talking
with your siblings or friends in English.

00:28:56.296 --> 00:28:59.472
Before your semester begins
in the next two months.

00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:00.000
From what I know,
most of you are high school graduates.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.464
From what I know,
most of you are high school graduates.

00:29:03.488 --> 00:29:10.216
I want to know the school or the major
you want to study in college.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:12.744
I’m Boy.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.792
I’m from Thepmongkol School.

00:29:13.816 --> 00:29:15.184
I want to study Architecture.

00:29:16.008 --> 00:29:18.010
An architect wannabe.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.992
I’m Mawin.

00:29:28.024 --> 00:29:29.216
I graduated from Baromavidya.

00:29:29.752 --> 00:29:31.750
I’m waiting for the result of my application
to the School of Communication Arts.

00:29:31.776 --> 00:29:32.400
Communication Arts.

00:29:32.456 --> 00:29:34.216
Everyone, calm down.

00:29:34.248 --> 00:29:35.712
Don’t be surprised.

00:29:35.736 --> 00:29:41.128
Most people expect Baromavidya kids
to attend a medical school.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.624
Not all of us.

00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:44.688
I…

00:29:44.712 --> 00:29:45.816
I want to be a DJ.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.240
You must be smart
since you studied at Baromavidya.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.624
I’m Boy.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.840
I already introduced myself.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.336
Can I talk casually to you?

00:29:57.368 --> 00:29:58.208
Do you mind?

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.880
No.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.000
I got a new friend.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.584
I got a new friend.

00:30:02.608 --> 00:30:03.560
Your time is over.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.144
Move.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.800
Hey, I’m Film.

00:30:05.848 --> 00:30:07.128
I’m going to study communications arts too.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:07.720
Really?

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.016
I’m waiting for the admission result.

00:30:10.048 --> 00:30:11.136
I didn’t pass the portfolio admission.

00:30:11.168 --> 00:30:12.240
I’m so sad.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.000
Do you want to grab something to eat after class?

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.064
Good.

00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:19.632
Boy will buy us a meal on the first day.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:21.912
I’m going.

00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:22.744
Thank you.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.304
Hey.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.848
Shall we visit a temple to pray to the gods?

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.288
Good idea.

00:30:39.352 --> 00:30:40.368
Shall we go swimming too?

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.896
Dipping into the water may help clear your head.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.696
I don’t want to go out.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.376
Let me recap the situation.

00:30:47.416 --> 00:30:49.736
Right now, you feel down

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.192
because you found out the truth
after scolding him.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.216
You feel bad and embarrassed.

00:30:58.248 --> 00:31:00.000
Because you acted crazy and unhinged
towards him.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.736
Because you acted crazy and unhinged
towards him.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.544
Am I right?

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.048
Are you my friend or enemy?

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.992
We should have parted on good terms.

00:31:15.016 --> 00:31:18.328
Instead, we ended things with hard feelings
because of my foolishness.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.728
You are not foolish.

00:31:19.776 --> 00:31:21.120
You are the smartest.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:26.216
Open your mouth.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.800
How long are you going to stay at my house?

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.024
You are leaving in three days.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.688
We want to spend time with you.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.080
I’m leaving in a few days.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.936
But I still don’t know what to do with this.

00:31:49.696 --> 00:31:51.700
If you are so in love with Mawin,

00:31:51.736 --> 00:31:53.264
Why don’t you cancel your plan
to go to America?

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.760
Are you crazy?

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.688
I worked hard to get the scholarship.

00:31:59.624 --> 00:32:00.000
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.448
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:32:02.472 --> 00:32:04.450
You shoot down all of our suggestions.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.336
How about this?

00:32:06.376 --> 00:32:08.072
You should apologize to him.

00:32:08.104 --> 00:32:09.240
That’s right.

00:32:09.272 --> 00:32:11.784
Are you going to apologize to him or us?

00:32:11.816 --> 00:32:13.368
I’m getting tired of comforting you.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.224
Now, I start to feel upset.

00:32:15.272 --> 00:32:17.048
Right. You’re getting annoying.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:18.024
True.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.192
[The shabu soup had tons of MSG.]

00:32:36.216 --> 00:32:37.816
[I drank eight liters of water already.]

00:32:37.848 --> 00:32:39.240
[I’ll be going to the bathroom all night.]

00:32:51.456 --> 00:32:54.616
SEER TK.
ERR.

00:32:58.648 --> 00:33:00.000
[How do I start a convo with someone?]
[If I want to make up with someone,
what should I do?]

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.488
[How do I start a convo with someone?]
[If I want to make up with someone,
what should I do?]

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.704
[Seer, I have nothing to update today.]
[I suddenly have this confidence.]

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:11.816
[I can do it.]
[Tomorrow is the exam day.
But I don’t feel stressed at all.]

00:33:11.848 --> 00:33:22.256
[Thank you for listening to me all this time.]

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.104
[How could you do this to me, Mawin?]

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.360
[Can you come to meet me tomorrow?]

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.504
Hold on, Merlin.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.704
How can you be sure that you can trust him?

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.552
Because I see your true color.

00:34:23.592 --> 00:34:24.968
Reveal yourself.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.504
No.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.808
Assassin.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.600
No!

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.424
How are you doing?

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.104
Good.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.448
You?

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:49.872
Good.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.424
Actually, not so good.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.856
I read your letter.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.000
I found it a few days ago.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.544
I found it a few days ago.

00:35:02.992 --> 00:35:04.990
Why didn’t you tell me
you wrote me a touching letter?

00:35:05.016 --> 00:35:05.872
How would I know about it?

00:35:05.904 --> 00:35:07.288
I put the notebook away when I got home.

00:35:07.408 --> 00:35:09.200
But you always took the notebook with you
everywhere.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.056
Are you crazy?

00:35:10.104 --> 00:35:11.584
Why would I take it with me
when the exam was over?

00:35:11.624 --> 00:35:14.032
Then you should have told me that
you wouldn’t take it with you after the exam.

00:35:14.064 --> 00:35:14.952
So this is my fault?

00:35:14.984 --> 00:35:16.600
You just read it?

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.920
I wrote a long letter to you.

00:35:18.968 --> 00:35:19.896
Why didn’t you tell me about it?

00:35:19.928 --> 00:35:22.024
Why did you let me berate you like a mad dog?

00:35:22.056 --> 00:35:24.424
I thought you’d read the letter,
but you were still mad at me.

00:35:24.448 --> 00:35:25.432
So I didn’t want to interrupt you.

00:35:25.464 --> 00:35:28.184
Among all the people I know,
you are the smartest.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.040
How can you act like a fool about this?

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.824
This is driving me crazy.

00:35:29.848 --> 00:35:32.120
Yes, it’s driving me crazy, too.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.872
You know that I got the scholarship, right?

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.544
I’m leaving for Boston.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.088
Why Boston?

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.584
Do you like the city?

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.552
I don’t know.

00:35:51.584 --> 00:35:53.550
I did some research on the internet.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.632
My grades passed their qualifications.

00:35:55.648 --> 00:35:57.048
I don’t know if I will like it or not.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:57.872
I’ll go and give it a try.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.000
Who knows,
I might run back home after a month.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.480
Who knows,
I might run back home after a month.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:03.648
What about you?

00:36:03.688 --> 00:36:04.528
What have you been doing?

00:36:04.848 --> 00:36:06.850
I’m taking an English course.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.296
Why?

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:12.570
So I can speak English.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.288
In case I get a call from Boston.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.320
I’m leaving tomorrow night.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:26.920
I have one free day today.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:31.080
Can I spend it with you?

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.224
I have to attend a class.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:37.464
Why don’t you come with me?

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.760
Are you sure I’m allowed to be in the class?

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.304
Yes, I can invite a friend to sit in on the class.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.592
Hello.

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.000
Applaud.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.448
Applaud.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.176
When I walk into the class,
you need to give me a round of applause.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.416
I was told there’s a sit-in student today.

00:37:08.456 --> 00:37:10.416
Where are you?

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.160
There you are.

00:37:16.184 --> 00:37:18.744
Please introduce yourself, the new student.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.952
Hello, I’m Anantachai.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.856
No.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.640
Just tell me your nickname.

00:37:25.664 --> 00:37:27.472
I can’t remember your first name anyway.

00:37:27.488 --> 00:37:28.608
I’m Err.

00:37:28.648 --> 00:37:30.968
I graduated from Baromavidya School.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.520
Another Baromavidya student.

00:37:34.568 --> 00:37:36.192
Err, can I ask you something?

00:37:36.216 --> 00:37:40.560
Is it true that
Baromavidya students study 20 hours a day?

00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:44.672
Is it true that they can solve complicated math

00:37:44.704 --> 00:37:45.792
without a calculator?

00:37:47.088 --> 00:37:49.504
Isn’t it something anyone can do?

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.680
Students from Baromavidya are super smart.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.784
He’s going to study abroad tomorrow.

00:37:57.816 --> 00:37:59.576
I invited him
so he can get used to the language.

00:37:59.616 --> 00:38:00.000
Where will you study?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.840
Where will you study?

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:03.000
Massachusetts.

00:38:03.032 --> 00:38:05.040
Oh, Massachusetts.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.280
Why do you all look confused?

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.192
Good.

00:38:08.232 --> 00:38:10.576
Let’s get back to our lesson.

00:38:10.608 --> 00:38:13.368
The class is going a bit faster today.

00:38:13.384 --> 00:38:18.136
Because Err needs to go back
and pack his bag.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.960
See you.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.200
Err, good luck. Have a safe flight.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.304
See you.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:32.072
See you.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.696
Where are we going next?

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.776
What do you usually do after class?

00:38:39.816 --> 00:38:41.264
I usually go to have a meal with them.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:43.512
So you will have a meal with me today.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.304
Sure.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.504
You are getting better.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.808
You made new friends.

00:38:54.736 --> 00:38:56.740
Did you become an extrovert?

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.488
They are friendly.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.912
So I’m not afraid to approach them.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.544
If everyone in the class were like Mangpor,

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:08.952
I would sit alone and talk to no one.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.856
Since you mention her, I start to miss them.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.160
Luckily, I follow them on IG.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.648
You should use social media too.

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:20.768
It’s not bad to post a photo once in a while.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.656
Do you often post photos on social media?

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.800
Every day, I post a story on IG.

00:39:29.144 --> 00:39:31.140
I have to try to remember the password.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.440
Why? Are you going to follow me?

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:37.320
Can’t I do that?

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.872
So I can see you often.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.752
I can call you.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.056
Every day?

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.640
I won’t even call my mom every day.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:58.560
What about me?

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.000
Will you call me every day?

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.568
Will you call me every day?

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:10.088
Have you been to America?

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:11.568
No.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.600
But I know that it’s very far from here.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.856
It will be the farthest country I’ve been to.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.256
To be honest, I’m scared.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.448
I’m going to live alone abroad.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.240
What are you afraid of?

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:33.208
I’m not sure.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.880
I’m afraid that things will change.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.224
What do you think it will change?

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:45.064
I…

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.248
Hello, Aunt Pen.

00:40:50.272 --> 00:40:51.680
Err.

00:40:51.704 --> 00:40:52.592
Are you here to see Mom?

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:53.184
Yes.

00:40:53.216 --> 00:40:55.208
I’m going to ask your mom
to go to the market with me.

00:40:55.232 --> 00:40:57.808
I’m going to ask Aunt Taew, too.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.000
I plan to visit a shrine tomorrow morning.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.272
I plan to visit a shrine tomorrow morning.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.576
I have an appointment with a fortune teller.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.432
Is he the fortune teller you have a fling with?

00:41:07.456 --> 00:41:09.430
No, it’s not a fling.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.592
We are dating.

00:41:11.608 --> 00:41:12.560
What?

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.224
You are a real deal.

00:41:14.248 --> 00:41:15.744
You’re dating a fortune teller.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.984
When I see you smile like this,
I really want to delete it from my sight.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:31.280
What does TK stand for?

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.800
My fortune teller account?

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.832
Don’t laugh if I tell you.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.728
TK stands for Takkrab, as in say hi.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:45.744
This is the best name you can come up with.

00:41:46.408 --> 00:41:47.712
It’s so outdated.

00:41:47.752 --> 00:41:49.264
It’s probably older than my mom.

00:41:49.288 --> 00:41:51.616
You know I barely spend time on the internet.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.416
Have a safe flight.

00:42:04.448 --> 00:42:06.056
Take care of yourself.

00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:08.488
Work hard at school and enjoy your time there.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.712
Do you still like me?

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.232
Can you like me for another four years?

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.248
I’ll call you every day.

00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:22.250
Whatever you want me to do, I’ll do it.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:25.888
I like you.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:28.192
I’m sorry for only telling you today.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.072
I really like you.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.000
Do you feel relieved after saying it?

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:42.080
Yes.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.920
Can I hold you?

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.008
Take good care of yourself.

00:42:56.048 --> 00:42:57.264
Hurry back.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.312
Don’t fall for anyone else.

00:42:59.336 --> 00:43:00.000
No, don’t talk to anyone.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.896
No, don’t talk to anyone.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.968
Can you do that?

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.152
What about you?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.800
Are you going to see someone
behind my back when you’re in college?

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.728
Your fortune teller account always
gets messages from dozens of people.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.248
They send the messages
because they want to talk to the fortune teller.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.024
Just like you did.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.376
Will you be the fortune teller’s boyfriend?

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.712
Then I’ll tell them
that I can no longer talk to them.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.904
Okay.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.576
I’ll be the fortune teller’s boyfriend.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.496
Pen, wait for me.

00:44:03.776 --> 00:44:04.768
Where is my bag?

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.936
Keys.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.816
Umbrella.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:09.688
Am I forgetting something?

00:44:09.728 --> 00:44:10.672
I don’t think so.

00:44:10.712 --> 00:44:11.944
I got everything.

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.992
I’m coming. Wait for me.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.144
Do you feel shy if your mom sees us?

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:26.840
Yes.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.032
Don’t you get shy when you’re with me?

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.544
I…

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.760
I don’t feel shy anymore.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.120
If I feel shy,
I can’t be the fortune teller’s boyfriend.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.224
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND. HAHA.

00:45:29.248 --> 00:45:31.232
DAMN!

00:45:31.264 --> 00:45:33.368
YOU’RE DATING A FORTUNE TELLER.
AWESOME!

00:45:33.392 --> 00:45:34.896
CAN I SEND THIS PHOTO TO TON?

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.376
I’LL SEND IT TO THE CAMP’S GROUP CHAT.
THEY WILL TEASE YOU ABOUT IT.

00:45:37.408 --> 00:45:38.848
MHEE ADDS ME TO THE GROUP CHAT.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.568
IF THEY DARE TO TEASE MY FRIEND,
I’LL HIT THEM.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.152
DAMN, YOU’RE DATING YOUR FORTUNE TELLER.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:55.056
It all began when I fell in love.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.592
Phu is in his last year in college.

00:45:57.616 --> 00:46:00.000
Why don’t you try the Chantharusati necklace?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.808
Why don’t you try the Chantharusati necklace?

00:46:00.848 --> 00:46:02.810
Fiat votum meum.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.272
I’ve been following the news about this cult.

00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:07.512
The cult is surely a scam.

00:46:07.544 --> 00:46:10.112
Although none of you agrees with me,

00:46:10.136 --> 00:46:11.616
At least I still have Ploy,

00:46:11.664 --> 00:46:14.896
who’s willing to expose the Chantharisatu’s scam.

00:46:14.928 --> 00:46:16.720
Chantharusati.

00:46:16.752 --> 00:46:20.688
This is one of the ways our family practices meditation.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.880
STEP INTO A DANGEROUS CULT.

00:46:24.912 --> 00:46:27.976
STEP INTO A BIZARRE CULT.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:31.248
Exposing them is harder than I thought.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.328
Got you.

00:46:32.376 --> 00:46:33.944
Father is manifesting his power.

00:46:33.968 --> 00:46:35.784
The power of Chantra is miraculous.

00:46:35.816 --> 00:46:39.576
Spiritual support is indispensable for our world.

00:46:39.616 --> 00:46:41.448
This business is so shady.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:43.104
Heart racing…

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.472
YOUR ASS!
