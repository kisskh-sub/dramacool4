WEBVTT

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:08.575
Do you know how much I've spent
to make you number one?

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:13.380
I am a host after all.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.281
I know.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:18.885
Yes, you are a host.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.088
I'm just happy to hear that you're well.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.225
Don't call me anymore, okay?

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.260
Bye.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:31.164
He put on an act for me.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.868
Now, I need to move forward too.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.971
I'm going to move out.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:40.840
Manami!

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.510
You need to calm down.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.847
There's no need to move out
in such a hurry!

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.449
My heart is set.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.384
You poor thing.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.554
- That host drove you mad.
- No.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.724
This is how you act
when you're blinded by something!

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.392
Remember?

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.729
Hey, don't remind her of that incident!

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.900
I'm not being reckless this time.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.371
And, I'm just going to go see
an apartment today.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.606
I'm not running away from home.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:14.841
Can I trust you?

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.213
See you later.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.470
EITA SAKURA
ARE KAORU AND TAKECHIYO ALL RIGHT?

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.938
{\an8}I SAW THIS ONLINE ARTICLE

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:50.410
{\an8}AN ASSAULT IN A HOST CLUB IN KABUKICHO

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.812
{\an8}A HOST FROM "THE JOKER" INJURED

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.318
{\an8}TAIGA TAKAMORI

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.123
How's the scene looking?

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.258
He got cut here.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.829
- Apparently, a host got stabbed.
- Is he dead?

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.030
I heard a woman did it.

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:12.932
- Here!
- The police took her away.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.734
- Any info on who's injured?
- Uh…

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.636
- Call the local news desk.
- Yes!

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.138
- And check social media.
- Noted!

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.774
- Shoot it this way.
- He's still inside?

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.776
I want to see Tsubasa!

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.545
- Excuse me.
- Get back, please!

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.347
Manami?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.283
Hey, Manami! What are you doing here?

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.318
Momoko, what happened?

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:34.821
{\an8}TEMPORARY CLOSURE

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:35.722
Tsubasa!

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.261
I don't know if it's true yet, but…

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:46.599
I heard Tsubasa was the target,
someone got hurt protecting him.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.636
Just go home for now.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.039
Coming to the crime scene is so stupid!

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.440
But…

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:58.912
Even if it is Kaoru,
there's nothing you can do!

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.283
What happened to not seeing him again?

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.020
Ms. Chihuahua!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.428
Ms. Chihuahua!

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.076
What are you doing here?

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.614
Were you worried about me?

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.416
Don't flatter yourself!

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.718
Hey, Manami!

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.954
You're overreacting.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.823
Hey, what's wrong?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.724
Miss?

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.659
- Miss?
- Manami!

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.462
Why did you want to stab Tsubasa?

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.103
Were you trying to kill him?

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.107
There you go…

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.177
Let's see.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:14.420
I remember you used to often get a fever
before school trips and stuff.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.859
Stay here tonight.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.497
Your dad would be furious
if you went home in this state.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.334
Right then, Miss…

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.036
Take care.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.641
Wait a minute!

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:38.344
Can I ask you who got stabbed?

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:43.883
It's Takechiyo.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.753
Apparently, he protected Tsubasa.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.222
Hard to picture, right?

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.957
How bad is the injury?

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:55.762
He got a few stitches in his arm, I think.

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:57.096
Who did it?

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.499
I heard it was a customer.

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:04.304
I see.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.973
Well, I need to go back to work.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.940
Take care of her.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.108
What?

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:11.177
We can't leave her on her own.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.047
And the club's closed, right?

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:15.415
Me?

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:19.218
Here. Use this to make an ice pack.

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.287
You're used to working with ice, right?

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:22.588
Yes, I am.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.190
Thank you!

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:26.592
I'll leave the rest with you.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.953
What should I do?

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.758
How do you use it then?

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.394
SEIJI OGAWA

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:05.498
Hello, this is Kawahara.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.600
When is the wedding?

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:10.136
Huh? Why are you calling so late?

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.671
I asked you, didn't I?

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:15.208
To take her hand and lead her
because she's indecisive!

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:19.312
I'm sorry, but I'm still not sure yet, so…

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.980
That is unacceptable!

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.917
You can't become an executive
if you can't even handle this!

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.424
Should you be doing this as the executive
of the harassment response department?

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.261
People are too afraid of harassment
to say what they want to say,

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:37.663
and it's damaging this society!

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.965
Don't you get it?

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.669
He hung up.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.306
Why do I have to get scolded at? Why?

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:48.374
Ow!

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:51.411
Where is Manami? What is she doing?

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:55.014
She betrayed my trust again.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.785
We have to act now or it'll be too late.

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.391
- Um…
- Hm?

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.761
Can I ask something?

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:16.269
Are you really off work because of Manami?

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.039
It's been a week, right?

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.442
Is that not a problem?

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:25.044
Not in my position!

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:32.051
All good.

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:44.130
Did you sleep?

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.468
Ms. Momotaro's gone back to work.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:53.973
Ready for the ice pack? Here goes.

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:57.844
Whoa, that's cold…

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.113
Are you okay?

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.353
What about you?

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.223
Your injury…

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.492
is it healed now?

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.760
You knew?

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.263
Should've told me!

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:20.666
You too. You should've told me!

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:34.013
Can I ask you…

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.351
how it happened?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.253
Right.

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:43.222
I fell down. I was drinking
with a customer and got too drunk.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.959
I thought hosts were good at lying.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.594
I'm telling the truth!

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.396
I'm clumsy.

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:58.471
You need to learn more
to become a top-tier host.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.041
You're so harsh!

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:04.110
I am your teacher.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:10.616
Oh, man…

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:19.725
We went all the way to Miura Beach
to say goodbye, yet here we are again.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.595
We're both pathetic, huh?

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:26.532
Yes. Pretty pathetic.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.204
This is why I hate it…

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:40.279
when you care about someone,

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.849
you become lame.

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:51.757
Were you always cool until now?

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:53.960
Yeah. Of course, I was!

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.796
I've always been cool, all my life.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.731
I see.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:01.334
Opposite to my life then.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:07.373
You do look like you've pursued
lameness your whole life.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.275
That's awful!

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:16.916
But I finally told my parents
that I'm moving out.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:19.685
They're against it,

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:24.290
but I'm 35 and I need to see this through.

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:27.994
Well done, Ms. 35!

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:31.097
This 23-year-old supports you!

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:35.234
Hey, don't mention our age gap!

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:46.479
Maybe I'll leave my dormitory
and move in with you.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.115
What?

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:56.088
You probably can't cook
or clean well, right?

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.324
Ouch.

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:02.828
I've lived on my own for a while,
so I'm quite good.

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:06.732
What do you think?

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:11.070
No.

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:18.244
What if I said I'll quit my job?

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.451
If I weren't a host,

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:30.823
could we meet up
and chat and stuff like normal people?

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:35.728
I thought being a host was your calling?

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:39.732
My boss told me I should quit.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:42.968
Maybe you should retire as a host.

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:45.538
Undisciplined people
will never become number one.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.177
Maybe I'm not cut out for it.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.048
I've talked too much.

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.718
Why aren't you asleep yet?

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:16.435
I'm back!

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:17.937
- Hi.
- Welcome back!

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:19.038
- Ichinose.
- Yes?

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.507
- Is the narration script ready?
- Yes!

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.677
A bizarre crime in Shinjuku
committed by a woman in her 50s.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.079
Was the target a host
she was obsessed with?

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:28.147
What do you think?

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:29.181
Make it shorter.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.783
- Okay.
- Yomoda!

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.952
Any info on Tsubasa?
The one who was targeted?

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:35.588
No injury, but he's seeing
the police again tomorrow.

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:36.522
Why?

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.125
We know him,
so we have to get an interview.

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:40.826
- I'll ask him myself.
- Thank you.

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:42.461
You're so reliable.

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:45.297
- Can you just start fixing the script?
- Yes!

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:21.734
MS. CHIHUAHUA
YOU'RE PRETTIER WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:26.939

OBON FESTIVAL

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:44.423
MS. CHIHUAHUA
YOU'RE PRETTIER WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.457
What?

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:49.728
Like this, and then another line,
and then straight…

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:53.899
Miss…

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:58.437
On the left.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:01.207
That's not right!

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:04.310
Sorry.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.448
It doesn't fit.

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:20.793
Perfect.

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:25.631
MS. CHIHUAHUA YOU LOOK

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.532
You're…

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:28.801
Pretty…

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.636
PRETTIER

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:31.537
Prettier.

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:35.741
Is that right?

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.944
There and then…

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:42.681
He had learnt some new kanji.

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:47.052
Writing this letter
must have been more difficult for him

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.955
than making me breakfast.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:55.761
There, done!

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:58.097
{\an8}TAKE CARE
TAIGA TAKAMORI

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:13.779
{\an8}OBON FESTIVAL

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:24.189
She's moving out?

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:28.594
It makes no sense to move out
before getting married!

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:31.964
So I need you to decide
the wedding date right away.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.233
But I can't decide that on my own…

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.068
Yes, you can!

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.436
No, but…

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.373
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.975
You're back!

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.444
Yoji and I were just talking
about the wedding!

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.579
You're indecisiveness is a huge issue.

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:49.715
So I asked him to hurry up and marry you.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.384
- Sir…
- What?

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.920
Can I talk to Manami alone?

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:57.389
Okay.

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:03.429
I'm so sorry that my dad kept calling you.

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:06.231
No, I asked if I could come over today.

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:09.335
I had a question for your dad.

00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:11.971
But I couldn't ask him.

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:14.340
What is it?

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:16.675
Well…

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:21.146
I thought your dad was acting strange.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:25.617
He's being beyond
overprotective of you, right?

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:33.058
So, I didn't want to intrude,

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:36.662
but I did some research
on your dad's company.

00:16:37.262 --> 00:16:41.800
His company is a client of my bank,
so it wasn't difficult to do research.

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:47.840
And?

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:54.880
Your dad's subordinate filed
a complaint of power harassment.

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:03.789
Your dad got isolated at work
as many agreed with the claim.

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:10.262
He's been told to stay at home for now,
but he'll probably be forced to resign.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:22.741
I think he's been rushing us
to get married because…

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:28.514
he wanted us to seal the deal
before he had to resign from work.

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:34.353
I do understand how he feels,
being a company employee myself.

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:40.426
Because the more you succeed,
the worse it is when you fail.

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:48.267
Why don't you talk to him properly?

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:54.940
I will.

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:07.786
Hey, Kaoru! Why are you here?

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:11.356
I felt restless.

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.569
I spoke to the police.

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:28.040
An officer I know told me indirectly

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:35.280
that Ms. Akina is also the prime suspect
in the murder of the number one host.

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:39.718
You must be joking.

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:44.490
I don't know what happened,
but I think it's also connected

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:47.793
to this incident.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.162
No way.

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:55.434
So, we drove her into madness?

00:18:56.935 --> 00:19:00.939
I'm sure the police will suspect
there was an issue with our sales methods.

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:07.112
I'll need to think carefully
about the future of this club

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.114
and notify everyone.

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:12.084
Boss!

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:22.661
Did you tell me I should retire
because you knew this might happen?

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.568
You won't close the club, will you?

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:34.406
I…

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:40.746
I will always be grateful
that we met that day.

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:55.561
Hey!

00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:59.565
- You guys are just full of energy.
- Come on.

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:01.600
Let's go.

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.535
Go!

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:14.012
Slow down and chew properly.

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:20.385
You made me realize that…

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:24.456
even a dumb jerk like me deserves to live.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.731
Kaoru.

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:37.035
I actually have…

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.973
a criminal record.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:49.281
I tried to quit my host club
because I fell for a girl,

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:52.417
but the owner forbade me to quit
so we got into a fight and…

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.787
I killed a staff member
who tried to stop us.

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:01.927
It's been 23 years already,
but I'll never forget it.

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:13.071
One thing I promised myself
when I opened this club

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:18.644
was to step away from this business
if anything happens

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.746
that threatens a person's life.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:26.652
If there's anything I can do,
please tell me.

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.091
Okay.

00:21:34.092 --> 00:21:35.294
Let's see.

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:39.031
In that case…

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:43.068
Start by cleaning this place up.

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.525
Right, let's start.

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:13.498
How do you feel about the fact
that Ms. Akina tried to stab you?

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.302
I wasn't surprised.

00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:23.075
I had a feeling she was the one
who murdered that number one, Jin.

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:26.111
Why was that?

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:29.414
I was friends with Jin.

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:33.752
He told me he had some issues
with Ms. Akina.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.758
You knew about it
yet you kept her as a customer?

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:46.198
I leeched off her as much as I could
before passing her on to Kaoru.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.371
I'm an awful person.

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:59.044
Do you want to apologize to Ms. Akina?

00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:04.182
Not really.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.219
She spent her money to have a good time.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.421
It's her own fault.

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.857
Her own fault?

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:18.864
Do you not realize
that you ruined that woman's life?

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:26.905
- You can talk.
- Huh?

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:29.708
You were attracted to me, too.

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:32.978
You used your work as an excuse to see me.

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.246
Don't be so sly.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.384
Independent-looking women like you
are the most persistent ones!

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:41.420
- Stop it!
- You want to sleep with me?

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:44.256
Hey, stop! Let go of me!

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:51.229
For a short period of time,
I did think about becoming your customer.

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.736
But unfortunately, I didn't get hooked.

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:01.139
I get it.

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:06.144
Any woman can get into…

00:24:08.313 --> 00:24:10.649
Ms. Akina's situation.

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:13.752
In total?

00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:16.922
At least 100 million yen, I think.

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:20.725
According to our research,

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:25.430
you even helped Jin cover
the deposits for his car and apartment.

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.201
How could you afford that?

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:33.572
You know it all already, right?

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:41.446
In the beginning,
I paid for Jin with my own money,

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:44.749
but I soon ran out.

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:47.886
As soon as I ran out of money,

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.390
he changed his attitude and became cold.

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:54.292
Then I will kill myself!

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:58.129
- Stop that! Stop it!
- No!

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:05.604
So are you saying
you didn't mean to kill him?

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:08.673
I don't care if you believe me.

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:10.809
Pour it!

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.077
Pour it!

00:25:12.143 --> 00:25:14.279
I was scared of getting caught.

00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:16.681
To try to forget reality,

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:20.986
I went to JOKER
and got addicted to Tsubasa.

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:24.356
I wanted to make him number one.

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:29.027
So I started using my company's funds.

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:31.062
But the company found out,

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.300
and a board meeting
was scheduled to question you.

00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:44.609
{\an8}I just wanted to see Tsubasa
one last time and say…

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:48.880
"Whatever happens,

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:55.987
I will always be rooting for you."

00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:00.392
But…

00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:07.198
He looked at me
like he was looking at something filthy.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.735
I thought, "I see.

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:16.308
He knew that I killed Jin
and was milking money out of me!"

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:21.446
So you decided to kill Tsubasa instead?

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:23.582
Not just him.

00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:28.820
All men who exploit women.

00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:30.589
All of them!

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.958
I wanted to kill all of them!

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:42.801
I've worked so hard by myself.

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:48.206
I wanted to be someone's number one.

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:51.910
I wanted…

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:56.081
to be genuinely thanked by someone.

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:01.086
I wanted someone in my life

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:05.957
who can't live without me!

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:11.963
{\an8}On the 18th of this month, Ms. Utsunomiya,

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.468
{\an8}tried to stab hosts with a kitchen knife
at the club "THE JOKER" in Kabukicho.

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:19.270
{\an8}Ms. Machida, Ms. Akina's case
was sent to the prosecutor.

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:23.775
- Okay. I see. Thanks.
- She also confessed to murdering a host…

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.880
{\an8}Thank you for lending me this book.

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:32.350
Are you okay?

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:36.755
You tend to struggle to let things go.

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:42.227
Even with students, you try too hard
and get disliked by them.

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:47.999
To be honest,
I was worried about you teaching Kaoru.

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:50.935
Is that why you helped me?

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:54.439
It's my duty as your assistant teacher.

00:27:55.874 --> 00:27:58.209
But I do feel relieved now.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:03.281
Nothing good can happen from a teacher
being associated with a host.

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:05.717
It's the right choice.

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:08.687
The right choice.

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:10.422
That's it.

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:13.425
I've always chosen the right path.

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:17.062
I didn't know how else to live.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.165
- I'm back!
- Welcome back!

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:23.334
I also washed yours.

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:25.336
Sorry! Thank you!

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:30.742
By the way, why did you protect Tsubasa?

00:28:32.477 --> 00:28:35.280
Well, I don't really know,

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:38.883
in the moment I saw him as a friend.

00:28:39.584 --> 00:28:40.985
It's weird 'cos I hated him.

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:44.389
I'm not surprised.

00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:46.658
- Ow.
- Give it here.

00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:47.826
Sorry.

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:51.196
- There you go.
- Thank you.

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:56.301
I'm worried about the club.

00:28:57.268 --> 00:29:01.406
Will there be fewer customers
because of the incident?

00:29:02.173 --> 00:29:03.641
I don't know.

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:11.049
Oh!

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:13.218
- It's from the club.
- What?

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:15.854
Hello.

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:17.989
Yes.

00:29:21.126 --> 00:29:22.193
Okay.

00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.130
Yes. See you later.

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:29.367
They're reopening today!

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.035
- Really?
- Yeah!

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.738
- I'm so happy! Ouch!
- Hey, take it slow.

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:35.273
I'll get ready and head out.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.475
Okay! I'll head there a bit later.

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:40.211
Let's do this!

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:41.346
All right!

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:54.993
REOPENING TODAY AT 7:00 P.M.!

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:56.461
All right.

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:57.362
Excuse me!

00:29:58.696 --> 00:29:59.898
Whoa, you scared me!

00:30:01.065 --> 00:30:01.900
Hi.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.904
Hi? That's all? After what you did?

00:30:07.138 --> 00:30:09.574
Wait, I…

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.745
Whoa, what is it?

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:16.281
- I really…
- You scare me.

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.415
I really am…

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:19.918
sorry!

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.988
It's fine.

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:26.558
- I'm busy with the reopening, so…
- Wait.

00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:29.861
- It's not open yet, right? Can I come in?
- What?

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:33.331
I want to know more about you.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.335
Hey, wait.

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:39.537
Please! Is this okay?

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.906
- It was written down!
- Morning!

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.508
- Morning!
- Hey, good morning!

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:44.843
You're fit to work now?

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:46.711
I'm good! Very good!

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:50.148
- I'm glad.
- Sorry, I worried you.

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:52.917
Right, this guy…

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:54.752
He's my friend.

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.487
He wants to become a host.

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:58.022
- What?
- Right?

00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:00.892
Yes. I'm his friend
and I want to be a host.

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:03.027
- Nice to meet you!
- You too.

00:31:05.763 --> 00:31:08.600
Walk properly
if you want to become a host!

00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:09.500
Yeah.

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:12.203
It's a completely different world.

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:13.838
Nice, right?

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:15.473
So? How can I help?

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.808
Yeah. You…

00:31:17.508 --> 00:31:21.946
You didn't tell Manami
or the police that I was the one

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:24.716
who injured you.

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:25.717
No.

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:30.622
W-Why didn't you?

00:31:32.323 --> 00:31:34.259
I didn't want to trouble her.

00:31:35.793 --> 00:31:38.463
If you get arrested
by the police for assault,

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:39.998
you'll lose your job.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:43.868
And I bet you work for a good company.

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:50.408
I thought that'll derail
the marriage plan.

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:53.945
By "marriage," you mean…

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:56.114
mine and Manami's marriage?

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.615
Who else?

00:31:58.416 --> 00:31:59.918
Sorry.

00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:04.756
It's okay.

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:14.399
I never hit anyone before.

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:17.669
When you hit someone,
you get injured too, huh?

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:19.804
That's obvious.

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:21.906
Are you okay?

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.909
Can you really make her happy?

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:29.781
- I think so.
- You think so?

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:35.053
You need to say, "Definitely".

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.423
Hey, Kaoru! Long time no see!

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:39.824
Hey, long time no see!

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:41.159
Let me know who's coming.

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:43.294
Yeah, okay! Will do!

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:47.265
Right, that's the end of your trial!
Get home safe.

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:50.335
It's been a while!

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:54.472
- It has!
- Hi, guys! Yeah!

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:55.974
Take it slow, okay?

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.609
- I'm totally fine!
- It must be nice to be young!

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.018
Kaoru!

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:09.220
There you go.

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:10.989
Oh gosh, shit!

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:17.895
See? What an outrageous incident!
I'm glad you weren't part of it!

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:22.333
Now get a move on
and get the wedding plans going

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:25.136
while he's still obsessed with you!

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:33.511
Mr. Kawahara said I should talk to you

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:36.280
before we start planning the wedding.

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:38.716
Talk about what?

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:43.755
About your company.

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.893
I heard about what's happened.

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:51.996
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:55.900
Nothing for you to worry about.

00:33:57.468 --> 00:34:01.272
Once you're in a higher position,
you become a target!

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:03.341
I will not lose!

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:06.511
They can't get rid of me this easily!

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:09.313
Is your life over if you lose your job?

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:12.350
No, right?

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:27.532
Tell us everything.

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:31.302
That's unnecessary.

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:41.079
It's my fault for being unreliable
and making you worry all the time.

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:45.283
You always had to act tough, even at home.

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:51.956
I'll move out now.

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:54.826
The marriage…

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:57.161
My work…

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:00.231
I need time to think on my own.

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.535
So dad, you can stop…

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:08.072
pressuring yourself.

00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:13.611
I'll find a place during the holidays
and let you know.

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:38.903
{\an8}HOST MURDER INCIDENT IN KABUKICHO

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:42.807
MANAMI OGAWA

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.342
Can I stay over for a while?

00:35:44.408 --> 00:35:47.478
- Ms. Machida, could you check this?
- Okay.

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:51.415
Did you finally convince your dad?

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.652
I need to get out for now.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.689
Okay. I support whatever you decide.

00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:01.192
Thank you.

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:03.294
I think it's my only chance.

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:07.498
Perfect. I wanted someone
to talk to tonight.

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:10.434
- Bye.
- I'll try to get home early.

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:13.871
JOKER's reopening today!

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:15.039
What? Really?

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:17.808
- Ouch! That's not it!
- What? This hurts? Sorry…

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:20.678
- I'll do it slowly. There!
- Ouch!

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:23.147
- You did that on purpose.
- No… Ouch!

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:25.183
- It hurts.
- We're so fragile.

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:29.120
I'm sorry about what happened.

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:32.256
How's your arm?

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.192
It's better.

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.962
If anything happens to me, help me then!

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:40.431
In that case, me too!

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.800
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.368
Meeting's about to start!

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:45.836
- Gather around!
- Yes!

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:52.243
Welcome back.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.678
Thank you!

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:54.812
Is everyone here?

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.147
Yes!

00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:59.483
I'm sure you've been anxious,

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:04.055
but as of today, THE JOKER will reopen!

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:06.023
- Yeah!
- Wow!

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.760
However, it's just for tonight.

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.662
- What? Why?
- Just tonight?

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:14.065
For the last ten years,

00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:17.468
THE JOKER has been a place filled
with dreams for so many people.

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:20.738
But sadly, one of our customers
has committed a crime.

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:26.043
Not saying it was our fault,
but this club did play a role in it.

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.546
We can't justify staying open.

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:29.880
Hang on a minute!

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:32.683
Is there nothing we can do?

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:35.219
I'll work hard! I'll do anything!

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.788
I want to keep working here.

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:40.925
I've built relationships
with many princesses!

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:42.994
I want to keep working, too!

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.695
- Boss!
- Let's not give up yet!

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:46.330
- Please!
- We can do this!

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:47.598
Boss!

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.570
The best solution
is for me to quit, right?

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:57.141
No. I'm taking all of the responsibility.

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:02.413
A day consists of daytime and nighttime.

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:07.385
Humans also need some time
out of the sunlight

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:10.621
where they can show their vulgar desires.

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:14.292
The outside world is tough,

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:17.261
so I wanted to provide a safe space
for men to compete.

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:18.529
That was my dream.

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:23.601
It's also why I riled you up.

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:31.375
However, the incident made me realize
that my ideas were wrong.

00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:37.648
Stop crying!

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:39.550
I'm sorry.

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.919
Kaoru, well said.

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:45.956
It's already been decided!

00:38:46.023 --> 00:38:48.793
We still have tonight!
Let's go out with a bang!

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.961
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:54.665
Everyone, start getting ready and smile!

00:38:54.732 --> 00:38:55.700
Yes.

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:58.602
Smile, everyone. We need to smile! Okay?

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:02.506
What is it?

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:04.675
I…

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:15.519
I'll give it my all today
and make it a hell of a night.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.355
No.

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:21.192
All you need to do is enjoy it.

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.869
- I was wrong. Sorry.
- Really?

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.637
- I'll go, let them know.
- Thanks.

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:37.475
We have no customers coming in!

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:39.276
That's so weird.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.446
I've let my girls know we're open today.

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:44.348
I also called my girls.

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.183
I think we all have.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.686
Do you think it's because of the incident?

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:49.954
Is that why?

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:53.624
We have a customer! Welcome!

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:55.593
Welcome!

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:57.795
Watch your step.

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.600
Yukari!

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:04.602
I missed you.

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:08.472
I felt hesitant, but I still came!

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:09.740
Thank you.

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:11.609
Welcome!

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:13.711
Welcome!

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:14.779
This way.

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:17.481
We have a customer! Welcome!

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:19.016
Welcome!

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.384
- Kaoru!
- What?

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:21.819
- Finally!
- Sorry, I'm late!

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:26.424
Let's make it a great night.

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:29.393
Welcome!

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:35.900
OBON FESTIVAL

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:50.581
MS. MANAMI OGAWA

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:53.584
{\an8}TAIGA TAKAMORI

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:05.563
MS. CHIHUAHUA
YOU'RE PRETTIER WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.572
Let's play the King's Game!

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:16.273
- The King's Game?
- Yes!

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.309
Can I join you?

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.210
- What?
- The King?

00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:20.277
- Really?
- You too?

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:22.413
I'll be your assistant today, Kaoru.

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:26.550
Drinking with the top two hosts?
Are you kidding me?

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:30.788
We're rivals, but I guess
I'll make an exception!

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:34.592
In that case,
as a gift for the both of you,

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.894
I want to order the most expensive drink!

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:39.163
Really? Are you sure?

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:02.019
You scared me!

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:07.691
Dad?

00:42:09.126 --> 00:42:10.127
Open the door!

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:15.933
What are you doing? Open it!

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.070
JOKER's last champagne
is a whopping five million yen a bottle!

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:22.806
Thank you very much!

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:26.043
Thanks!

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:31.215
On top of that, to celebrate today,

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:36.186
here's a special champagne tower
as a gift to everyone from THE JOKER!

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:39.123
Gather around, please!

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.591
- Let's go.
- Okay!

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:44.428
This is amazing!

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:46.397
You took too long!

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:49.633
Open the door! Please!

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.637
Hey, this is insane!

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.009
You're not capable of anything!
I can't let you go!

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.946
Why would you say that?

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:05.416
Do you think you got into
that publisher all by yourself?

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:10.521
I asked the CEO to hire you!

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:16.160
You got to work in that department
not because your exam score was good,

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:18.429
but because I asked!

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:21.065
After you fell
for that stupid guy and quit,

00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:23.934
I asked your school principal
to hire you as a teacher!

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:28.539
You can't do anything without my help!

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:29.440
Don't you get it?

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:31.642
I know that!

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:34.745
That's why I told you I'm moving out!

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:36.780
Enough already!

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:43.854
Manami! Go!

00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:45.089
- Hurry!
- Move!

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:46.991
Hurry up and go!

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:48.926
- I'll be fine!
- Manami!

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.561
Manami!

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.509
{\an8}Looking back was not an option.

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:07.645
{\an8}I ran.

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:13.017
{\an8}The streets I knew well
didn't feel familiar.

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:20.224
{\an8}Thank you all for coming
on THE JOKER's final night!

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:26.230
{\an8}"That night THE JOKER
was the place to be in Kabukicho."

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:29.266
{\an8}I want people to remember us that way.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.138
{\an8}So I want all of us here tonight
to party until we drop!

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:35.406
{\an8}Let's go!

00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:37.274
{\an8}- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.842
{\an8}Let's go!

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:40.177
{\an8}- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:41.645
{\an8}Let's go!

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:43.213
{\an8}- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.582
{\an8}- Kaoru! Please take over!
- Sure!

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:47.217
{\an8}- Well then!
- Yeah!

00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:48.919
{\an8}- JOKER's last night!
- Yeah!

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:51.155
{\an8}- The special champagne!
- Yeah!

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.890
{\an8}- Let's open it!
- Yeah!

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.393
{\an8}Pour it!

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.028
{\an8}Pour it!

00:44:58.095 --> 00:44:59.663
{\an8}Pour it!

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.864
{\an8}Pour it!

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:02.700
{\an8}Pour it!

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:04.001
{\an8}Pour it!

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:05.903
{\an8}Pour it!

00:45:05.969 --> 00:45:07.304
{\an8}Pour it!

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.073
{\an8}Fever JOKER!

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:10.574
{\an8}Fever JOKER!

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:41.271
He cares about you more than I do.

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:43.774
I was hoping you and Ms. Chihuahua
would get together.

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:46.110
I can't live the life you want me to live.

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:47.377
Ms. Chihuahua!

00:45:49.012 --> 00:45:53.951
{\an8}THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS

00:45:54.017 --> 00:45:55.018
