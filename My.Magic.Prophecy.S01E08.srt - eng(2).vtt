WEBVTT

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.136
What’s happening?

00:00:01.152 --> 00:00:02.112
The chief’s truck went off the mountain.

00:00:02.128 --> 00:00:03.320
Let’s go help.

00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:04.288
I’m a doctor!

00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:05.344
He really is a doctor.

00:00:05.368 --> 00:00:07.824
I bought this for you so you’ll be safe.

00:00:07.848 --> 00:00:11.008
I don’t think Kasidis is acting alone.

00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:12.360
Finish him off then.

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:13.328
I’m going to Mae Hong Son.

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:14.368
Wait.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.580
I’m coming with you.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.440
In my dream, you were lying there,
covered in blood.

00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:20.440
I don’t know if I can save you in time.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.504
Someone came in to donate his blood.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Wan!

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.568
Morning, In.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.856
In, help me fill the hole back in.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.888
No.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.088
It’s gonna die.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.784
I’ve got a black thumb.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.432
Let me see.

00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:20.808
Come here.

00:02:20.832 --> 00:02:21.600
Thap!

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.064
Look at your hands. Gosh!

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:25.904
I’m all messy now.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.128
You don’t have a black thumb. Such a liar.

00:02:31.232 --> 00:02:33.072
I’m just afraid it’ll die.

00:02:33.584 --> 00:02:37.688
In, if it dies, we can just plant another one.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.200
Besides, it’s not dead yet.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
Mm.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.872
Come on, Thap.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.728
Mr. Inthu, don’t worry so much

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.730
about something that hasn’t even happened.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.760
Hm?

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.616
Just because you’re a fortune teller

00:02:56.656 --> 00:02:59.176
doesn’t mean you have to
know everything about the future.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.544
Don’t overthink it.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.550
Mm.

00:03:04.776 --> 00:03:07.472
Now, it’s your turn.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.590
Hey!

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.504
You wanna play, huh?

00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:16.190
We should name our tree together.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.760
- Mm.
- What should we call it?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.784
How about Inthu?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.870
Isn’t Inthap better?

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.392
Right, Inthap.

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:31.888
I said it wrong.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.130
Inthap, it is.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.232
That sounds great—Inthap.

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:36.360
- Mhm.
- Okay.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.192
So your name will be here too.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.672
Hello, Inthap.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.000
How’s Thap doing right now, In?

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.120
Thap is…

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.470
safe now.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.032
Goodness.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.896
It’s gonna be fine now.

00:05:46.928 --> 00:05:49.112
God bless you, dear.

00:05:49.928 --> 00:05:51.576
It’s all good now.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:00.848
In, isn’t it time you tell me about Thap
and the reason you brought him here?

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.504
Actually, you didn’t have to hide it.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.056
If I’d known, I could’ve helped too.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.936
Things happened so fast, Uncle Ju.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I didn’t think it through.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.176
I just thought if people knew,

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.584
Thap would be in danger.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.208
I understand that.

00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:33.616
But you don’t have to worry now.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.520
Thap is safe.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.552
In, aren’t you happy that Thap is safe, dear?

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.090
Hm?

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.184
From what I see, In,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.976
Thap makes it very clear
how he feels about you.

00:06:58.016 --> 00:06:59.980
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have noticed.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.176
So why the sad face?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.136
His family is here…

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.560
and I guess I don’t know where I fit in.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.064
I’ve been on my own for so long.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.408
I never had to consult anyone
when making decisions.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.656
So I forgot…

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.832
how important a family’s opinion can be.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.544
In, listen to me.

00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:49.208
Family doesn’t want much from us,

00:07:50.392 --> 00:07:52.390
only to see us happy.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.440
And from what I see,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.304
Thap’s happiness is you, In.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.824
Just cry, dear.

00:08:15.864 --> 00:08:17.344
Go on and let it out.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.020
In…

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.464
Have you had any sleep?

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.024
Dao’s here, asking for you.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.432
I told her to wait at the hospital.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.060
Got it.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.368
Are you holding up okay?

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.352
I need to bring you in to give a statement.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.744
Then we’ll go see Thap after.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.824
He’s out of the ICU.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.256
His family is moving him to Bangkok
tomorrow for further treatment.

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:22.760
Are you going back with us?

00:09:23.704 --> 00:09:25.700
I still have things to take care of here.

00:09:27.328 --> 00:09:29.330
Oh, by the way,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.232
what’s the news about the culprit?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.576
He hasn’t confessed.

00:09:34.952 --> 00:09:36.296
Still waiting for his lawyer.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.940
In

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.184
Is something bothering you?

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.400
I’m not sure yet.

00:09:47.936 --> 00:09:49.016
It’s just…

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.400
Ton, do you think he’s working alone?

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.672
Of course not.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.160
I just don’t have proof yet.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.344
So you already have someone in mind?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.224
I can’t say until it’s clear.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.888
But people like this never go down alone.

00:10:09.936 --> 00:10:13.024
Should we get going then?

00:10:18.624 --> 00:10:21.176
Why did you do it?

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.008
Please answer.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.944
Do you have an accomplice,
or were you acting alone?

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.048
Business conflict or personal?

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:33.344
At present, police are escorting
Mr. Kasidis Rakvanit

00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:36.776
from Phu Dao Police Station
in Mae Hong Son Province

00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:39.384
back to Bangkok for prosecution.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.352
Please answer the questions.

00:10:40.376 --> 00:10:41.840
Clear out of the way, please.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.056
Check in on Thap for us.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.216
We’ll see you back in Bangkok.

00:10:59.264 --> 00:11:00.848
Go on, hurry up.

00:11:00.888 --> 00:11:03.264
If he wakes and doesn’t see you, he’ll sulk.

00:11:10.368 --> 00:11:12.370
Our friend Thap is definitely in trouble.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.440
I feel bad for In.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.424
Don’t you feel bad for this poor police officer?

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.180
No.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.776
Just drive carefully, Inspector.

00:11:28.816 --> 00:11:29.816
I’m going to nap.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.864
What?

00:11:32.888 --> 00:11:34.728
You can’t get bossy until you’re my boyfriend.

00:11:36.184 --> 00:11:38.180
If you get tired, let me know.

00:11:38.224 --> 00:11:39.224
I’ll take the wheel.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.712
- Thap!
- Thap is awake.

00:11:50.728 --> 00:11:51.448
Ouch.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.728
Slow down, guys.

00:11:52.752 --> 00:11:53.300
Are you hurt?

00:11:53.336 --> 00:11:54.000
I’m sorry.

00:11:54.032 --> 00:11:57.136
Thap, how are you feeling? Does it hurt?

00:11:57.168 --> 00:11:58.920
My best boy.

00:11:58.944 --> 00:11:59.944
Thap.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.544
You’re tough as nails.

00:12:04.552 --> 00:12:05.672
What amulet are you wearing?

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.952
Shut it, jackass!

00:12:17.144 --> 00:12:18.144
Hi, ma’am.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.552
Hi there.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.760
Wan, dear, you came just at the right time.

00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:26.472
Thap just woke up.

00:12:26.504 --> 00:12:27.504
Come.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.190
Thank you, Wan,

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.944
for donating blood for Thap.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.424
It’s no problem at all, sir.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.168
Thap, how are you feeling?

00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:45.984
They didn’t have your blood type
ready for the operation.

00:12:46.192 --> 00:12:48.190
Wan happened to be here for a concert,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.968
so he came with his fans to donate.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.856
Thanks, Wan.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.848
I’m glad I could help.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.432
This is pure destiny.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.592
If you two don’t mind,
I think you should get back together.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.800
Mom.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.624
Sounds good?

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:19.664
Yes, ma’am.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.970
In.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.112
Hi, Thiwmek.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.736
Aren’t you going to see Thap
while you’re here?

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.176
I…

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.600
I don’t think so.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.296
Too many people.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.920
Don't you want to see Dao too?

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.616
That girl even wanted to run up
the mountain just to see you.

00:14:16.152 --> 00:14:18.150
Don’t you want to know how Thap’s doing?

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.784
How is he?

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.816
He woke up, called a nurse,
and prescribed himself sleeping pills.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.800
As if he’s trying to avoid someone.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.048
It’s good he’s getting enough rest.

00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:41.050
Tell him I sent my regards.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.832
Tell Dao I will see her back in Bangkok.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.840
Will you excuse me?

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.780
Goodbye.

00:15:00.616 --> 00:15:03.072
You’re screwed, Thap.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.656
Here, have this.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.704
Oh, I’m a doctor.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.872
Yes, Mom.

00:16:34.888 --> 00:16:36.870
Thap will be transferred to Bangkok today.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.512
- Dao.
- Hm?

00:16:57.536 --> 00:16:58.928
Can you reach In?

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.848
Not at all.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.048
He’s not picking up my calls.

00:17:02.408 --> 00:17:03.544
Try calling him again.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.920
I can’t get through.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.000
Aw, someone’s crying

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.184
There, there.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.576
I’ll come back to you as soon as I can.

00:17:39.608 --> 00:17:41.992
I don’t want you to leave.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:50.376
Don’t forget your promise
to be the top student in class.

00:17:50.416 --> 00:17:52.088
I promise.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.728
Don’t forget to bring Thap with you too.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:01.736
I promise.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.776
Aw, come here.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.344
Pay attention in class, okay?

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:15.830
Okay.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.144
I should get going.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Goodbye.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.688
Goodbye, Auntie Pian.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.280
Off he goes.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.120
Have a safe journey back.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.370
Thank you, Venerable Grand Father.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.096
Human hearts are fragile, In.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.536
They are fragile and easily swayed.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.968
Watch your heart closely
and keep it under control.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.200
Don’t let it get swept away with the crowd.

00:18:57.216 --> 00:18:58.216
Alright?

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.660
Yes, Venerable Grand Father.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.152
(Hi.)

00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:24.128
Hello.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.800
(Are you a relative of a patient
named Thapfah Kittipokin?)

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.568
(He forgot something at the hospital.)

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.224
Okay. I’ll be right there.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.200
I’m here to collect
a patient’s belongings, please.

00:19:40.224 --> 00:19:41.976
His name is Thapfah Kittipokin.

00:19:42.016 --> 00:19:43.980
Just a moment, sir.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.520
Here you go, his personal belongings.

00:19:51.552 --> 00:19:54.208
They must have been
left behind in the ambulance.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440
Thank you.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.790
Of course.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.336
IN, ARE YOU HOME YET?

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.120
HOW ARE YOU? ANSWER ME!!

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.424
IN!!!

00:20:45.448 --> 00:20:47.192
HOW ARE YOU?

00:20:47.224 --> 00:20:49.904
I’M WORRIED OVER HERE.

00:20:49.936 --> 00:20:52.960
WHEN WILL YOU EVER REPLY TO ME?!

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.424
MY IMPORTANT ONE IS SAFE NOW.

00:21:00.448 --> 00:21:03.152
THANKS TO MY “YIM WAN” FANDOM
FOR THE SUPPORT

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.608
AND ALL WHO DONATED BLOOD.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.184
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.128
DID I KEEP YOU WAITING TOO LONG?

00:21:56.152 --> 00:21:57.848
WILL YOU BE MY BOYFRIEND?

00:21:57.888 --> 00:21:59.000
MY IN.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.912
What’s wrong with the camera?

00:23:41.944 --> 00:23:42.944
Hey, hey.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.024
Nothing is wrong.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.424
It’s working just fine.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.704
- What?
- It’s not broken.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.200
- Really?
- Yes!

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.944
Let’s take more photos together.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.128
You reek of booze.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.760
What?

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:00.256
Reek?

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.024
How can you say that to Thapfah?

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.184
Thapfah always smells good.

00:24:07.208 --> 00:24:08.448
If you don’t believe me, sniff.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.176
Gosh, you stink.

00:24:25.848 --> 00:24:31.936
“And now these three remain:
faith, hope, and love.”

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.192
“But the greatest of these is love.”

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.448
I suggest you confess.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.928
You won’t get off the hook anyway.

00:24:53.624 --> 00:24:55.976
Fine, I’ll tell you…

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.300
just because I feel sorry for you policemen
and your lack of competence.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:04.960
Cut the act.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.880
Inspector, you can’t even tell
a lousy act from the truth.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.616
What do you want to know? Ask away.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.168
The shoot?

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.072
Yes, I did it. You saw it.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.320
It’s a shame he didn’t die and end it all.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.944
Watch your damn mouth.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.408
What else?

00:25:28.448 --> 00:25:29.704
The falling metals on his head?

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.140
That was me too.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.776
His punctured tires?

00:25:32.816 --> 00:25:34.112
Also me. Are we done?

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.680
And the car accident? Was that you?

00:25:37.784 --> 00:25:38.816
Which one?

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.496
If you mean when he got rear-ended,

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.176
I didn’t do it.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.440
Oh, and the security guard, too.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.600
I had nothing to do with it.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.632
So you’re admitting you’re not acting alone?

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.608
Come on, Inspector.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.992
Think. Use your brain.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:09.840
Do you really think an actor like me
could pull all this off alone?

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.016
Think, officer.

00:26:12.056 --> 00:26:15.488
Who else would Doc Thapfah
have issues with?

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.360
Don’t be dumb, kiddo.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.140
Think hard.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.056
I brought you coffee.

00:26:38.736 --> 00:26:39.736
Here.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.550
Thank you.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.528
How’s it going?

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.112
Got anything from him?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.416
I did, but the evidence…

00:26:54.928 --> 00:26:56.930
You caught him red-handed.

00:26:56.952 --> 00:26:58.248
Do you still need more evidence?

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.376
I’m not talking about Kasidis.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.392
There’s someone working with him.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.864
Pong, here’s the thing.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.560
There are two different cases here.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:20.880
One: Kasidis killing Tara and her parents
to get the hospital’s shares.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.848
Two: Some guy trying to take this chance
to finish Thap off.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.744
How did Thap get caught up in this?

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.168
That’s what I must find out.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.960
So what In said was right.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.960
Kasidis isn’t doing this alone.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.740
That’s right.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.560
How did In know about this?

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.304
Maybe I should consult a fortune teller too.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.208
Is it necessary?

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.750
What is?

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.568
Sitting too close to me.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.360
Ah, this?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.680
I want to.

00:28:24.464 --> 00:28:27.288
I’m tired. Please be kind to me.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.360
No.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.304
It’s your workplace.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.184
We’re good now.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.744
Get used to this place.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.240
After this case,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.840
you’re going to have a police boyfriend.

00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:24.296
What a showoff.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.784
Yes.

00:30:22.808 --> 00:30:24.408
I’ll see you soon, dear.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.912
Wan is coming to visit.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.784
Yes, Doctor?

00:30:47.816 --> 00:30:49.608
No… Yes, Patient?

00:30:49.632 --> 00:30:52.264
One tablet of 0.5 mg Lorazepam, stat.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.512
Stat.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:02.024
Thap, Wan is coming.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.480
Try to be smiley and welcoming, son.

00:31:04.504 --> 00:31:05.712
Like this.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.400
Or this.

00:31:07.624 --> 00:31:08.624
Yes, Mom.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.392
Mom.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.400
Yes?

00:31:13.424 --> 00:31:14.632
I already have someone...

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.208
Hey!

00:31:16.248 --> 00:31:17.464
Wan must be here.

00:31:21.048 --> 00:31:22.304
In, dear!

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.408
- In!
- Are you here to visit Thap?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.192
In!

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.704
Where have you been?

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.544
Hello, ma’am.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:30.344
Hello, dear.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.640
Hope you’re doing okay.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:33.856
Hello, Thap.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.192
Hello.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.680
Damn you.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.352
You didn’t pick up my calls.

00:31:38.368 --> 00:31:39.312
I couldn’t reach you.

00:31:39.336 --> 00:31:40.232
What the hell happened?

00:31:40.256 --> 00:31:41.680
I thought you were dead.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.720
Easy.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.256
I was busy.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:46.432
I’m here now, aren’t I?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.280
What a pain.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.976
The sleeping pill you asked for, Doctor.

00:31:56.912 --> 00:31:58.520
It’s okay. I don’t want it anymore.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320
In.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.232
Do we have to go buy coffee now?

00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:14.336
I want to have a chat with In.

00:32:14.352 --> 00:32:16.776
Mom, let them talk.

00:32:16.824 --> 00:32:18.096
Come on, Mrs. Thappee.

00:32:18.128 --> 00:32:19.840
My name is Thepee.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.456
Where have you been, In?

00:32:25.616 --> 00:32:27.620
I’m here to bring you your phone

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.824
and ask where I should
send the rest of your things.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.736
You can give me my phone now.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.872
As for the rest, keep them at your place.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.000
What’s the matter, hm?

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.592
Thap, your wound might hurt.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.384
A hurting wound is nothing,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.272
but a disappearing boyfriend…

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.544
Still got a nice mouth.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.112
Seems like you’ll recover
in no time without me visiting.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.500
Hold on, In.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.832
The one sulking here should be me, okay?

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.440
Think about it. I got shot

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.808
and woke up without seeing my boyfriend.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.976
Not only that,

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.184
when I finally see him, he’s sulking.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.248
So what are the symptoms?

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.024
Tell your doctor here.

00:33:40.048 --> 00:33:41.296
I’m sorry.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.056
I just…

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.072
I didn’t know how to act.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.744
There were so many people.

00:33:51.224 --> 00:33:53.220
I didn’t know where to place myself.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.368
And I didn’t know what status
I should use to visit you.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.200
You can come as my boyfriend.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.456
A boyfriend who can’t even take care of you?

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.752
Your parents almost lost you on my watch.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.672
That’s upsetting.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.416
In, In.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.400
I’m safe now, aren’t I?

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:25.264
Besides, a very good fortune teller
gave me this amulet.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.790
I’m hard to kill.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.288
Thap.

00:34:30.464 --> 00:34:31.464
Hey.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.544
You are…

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.344
In, right?

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
That’s right.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.380
Hi, there.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:40.670
Hi.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.456
Ah!

00:34:44.376 --> 00:34:45.376
You’re jealous?

00:34:49.288 --> 00:34:50.184
Hey.

00:34:50.216 --> 00:34:54.792
In, Mrs. Thepee told me
you saved Thap’s life. Is that true?

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.210
I did.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.144
Thank you so much.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.808
It’s my pleasure.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.752
Wan, In is my boy—ouch!

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.024
Thap, does your wound hurt?

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.312
I’ll go get a nurse

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.288
That’s alright. I’ll do it.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.584
No, it’s fine. I’m leaving anyway.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.456
You can stay, Wan.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.584
Ah, okay

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.152
Hey, In.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.840
Mrs. Thepee said you’re a fortune teller,

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:27.856
and a very good one.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.736
You like having your fortune told?

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.104
I love it.

00:35:35.976 --> 00:35:37.980
But in the old days,

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.896
every time I had my fortune told,
someone would sulk.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.432
Can you please give me a reading?

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.050
Hey, Wan.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:53.504
In doesn’t agree to
read anyone’s fortune so easily.

00:35:53.528 --> 00:35:54.528
Thap.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.056
Have you forgotten that I’m his fan?

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.480
I haven’t.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.792
What do you want to know, Wan?

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.552
How about… love?

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:14.624
I want to know if I have a chance
to get back together with my ex.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.792
Wan, you can just ask me that.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.600
Do you still love them, Wan?

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.248
I guess so.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.888
Then you don’t need a fortune teller.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.192
Love is about two people.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:42.976
If you still love them, then go for it.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:46.700
That’s true.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.848
Thank you, In, for reminding me of that.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.872
If you’ll excuse me now.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.860
Okay.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.980
In.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.592
Get well soon, Thap.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.020
Hello, Tul.

00:37:52.296 --> 00:37:53.344
Hello, Dao.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.520
Did In call you?

00:37:54.544 --> 00:37:56.016
No. What’s up?

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.400
He asked us out for drinks tonight.

00:37:59.416 --> 00:38:00.416
What?

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.640
Really?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.392
What’s gotten into him?

00:38:04.424 --> 00:38:07.176
I don’t know. He also said not to bail on him.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.384
“Not drunk, not going home.”

00:38:08.832 --> 00:38:10.368
Unbelievable!

00:38:10.784 --> 00:38:11.872
That’s what I think too.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.576
I’ll see you.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.152
Ever since you woke up,

00:38:21.656 --> 00:38:23.660
we haven’t had a chance to talk in private.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.864
I haven’t had a chance to
thank you properly, either.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.400
Thank you for your blood.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.880
You’re very welcome.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:43.912
I’m so glad I could do anything for you at all.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.610
- Wan…
- Thap…

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.248
You can go first.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.280
Okay.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.584
No, I’ll go first.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.896
I…

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.416
I was serious

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.136
when I said I wanted to
get back together with you.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.912
I also want to apologize for leaving you.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.800
Everything was so overwhelming back then.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:28.930
I’m sorry.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.240
It’s all good, Wan.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.832
It was a long time ago.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400
It’s fine.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.100
So…

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.960
If today I’m ready to focus on us,

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.440
is there a chance for me?

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.488
I already have someone.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.500
Have you been together long?

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:19.570
Not long,

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.320
but it feels so good.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.448
And I’m very confident about this.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.584
May I ask who it is?

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.140
In.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:41.370
But…

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.680
Don’t you hate fortune tellers?

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.744
Yes, I do hate fortune tellers.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.304
But for me, In can be anything,

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.490
as long as he’s being himself.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:05.528
Do you realize how much you’ve changed?

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.856
The old Thap wouldn’t have yielded to this.

00:41:11.016 --> 00:41:15.840
You never gave in to anything
that went against your beliefs.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.020
Wan,

00:41:26.344 --> 00:41:31.696
if I ever wronged you in any way, I’m sorry.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.440
No.

00:41:37.192 --> 00:41:39.190
I just feel like it’s a shame.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.600
You know,

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.928
this Thap is the man
I wanted you to be so bad back then.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.368
That means I was horrible before.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:54.290
Right?

00:41:55.768 --> 00:41:59.216
That’s why you left me as soon as
the fortune teller said that, hm?

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.460
It wasn’t because of the fortune teller, Thap.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.560
It was us.

00:42:17.152 --> 00:42:19.150
You were studying really hard,

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.552
and I was still young.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.968
You were also a super perfectionist.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.616
I just felt like…

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:34.488
I always had to play catch-up with you.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.176
But no matter how much I chased,

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.120
I never felt good enough.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.500
Wan.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.624
From the day we got together,

00:42:56.392 --> 00:42:58.390
I never wanted you to feel that way.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:00.970
It’s true.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.180
Yes.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.432
It also wasn’t the right time.

00:43:10.056 --> 00:43:18.056
Do you remember how upset your dad was
when he found out about us?

00:43:19.024 --> 00:43:22.570
Oh, very.

00:43:24.832 --> 00:43:26.830
The other day, when you woke up,

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.400
your dad thanked me.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.104
I almost cried.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.510
I saw that.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:44.840
It takes growing up to learn things like this.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.184
But it’s too late now.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:52.824
At least right now,

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.192
we’re having a heart-to-heart.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.300
Yeah.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:07.288
Hey, Thap.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.264
He’s cute.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.352
Take good care of him.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.096
Did he say he’s my fan?

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.560
Let me know if he wants a photo with me.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540
Please, no.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.152
That’d be too weird.

00:44:21.176 --> 00:44:23.712
Look how sulky he already is.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:29.728
Then take good care of my Yim Wan.

00:44:30.856 --> 00:44:32.860
The leader of the fandom is asking you here.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.530
What’s a fandom?

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.048
What? You don’t know what fandom is?

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.272
I don’t. What is it?

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.136
I have a fan club, right?

00:44:43.176 --> 00:44:44.776
This group of people is called a fandom.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.344
It’s good you’re all here.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.980
I have an announcement to make.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.808
I’m dating In.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.810
What? Are you serious, Thap?

00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.230
Nice!

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.010
You knew about this?

00:45:03.328 --> 00:45:05.330
As if it’s so hard to tell.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.120
I knew it.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.496
So you two knew?

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.136
When?

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.688
Goodness! Wait!

00:45:17.728 --> 00:45:20.752
Did In and Wan meet each other today?

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.440
Of course they did.

00:45:23.808 --> 00:45:26.496
Look who’s living a double life.

00:45:26.528 --> 00:45:29.520
Hey, hey, watch it, dude.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.488
I only have one life, asshole!

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:38.904
Dao, did In say why he’s mad at me?

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.272
He didn’t even visit me in Mae Hong Son.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:43.712
I don’t know.

00:45:43.728 --> 00:45:44.648
He did.

00:45:44.664 --> 00:45:45.664
Huh?

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:46.876
He always came to visit you.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.900
What?

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.104
He was there during the surgery
and also after you were moved here.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.312
He must have heard
when Mom told you to get back with Wan.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.864
- Mom!
- Mom!

00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:59.584
Well, I didn’t know!

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.672
Goodness me! Dao, call In for me now.

00:46:02.696 --> 00:46:05.152
Do it now. Help me. I didn’t know.

00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:08.060
In must be really upset.

00:46:09.416 --> 00:46:11.420
It’s not just about you, Mom.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.704
Thap, have you got your phone back?

00:46:14.744 --> 00:46:15.744
Yeah.

00:46:15.968 --> 00:46:17.970
Check your ex’s Instagram.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:20.104
What now, Dao?

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.304
Gosh!

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:29.960
Has In seen this?

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.232
He even liked the post.

00:46:33.264 --> 00:46:35.200
Damn it!

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.200
You’ve got so much work to do.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.440
Act quick, Thap.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.496
Tonight, In asked his friends out for drinks.

00:46:41.536 --> 00:46:43.448
He said he’s so sad.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.656
“Not drunk, not going home.”

00:46:44.696 --> 00:46:45.696
Seriously?

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.640
I’m gonna go now. Bye.

00:46:49.688 --> 00:46:51.568
Take care of Thap, Mek.

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:52.408
Bye.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.336
Dao.

00:46:53.376 --> 00:46:54.456
Hey, Dao.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.096
Come back and help your brother.

00:46:58.152 --> 00:46:59.728
I want to be discharged now.

00:47:05.336 --> 00:47:07.240
Nurse, be notified:

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.424
Room 2706, patient named Thapfah,

00:47:10.456 --> 00:47:12.168
is to be discharged stat, by Doctor Thapfah.

00:47:12.184 --> 00:47:13.184
Thank you!

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.060
I have to change.

00:47:17.552 --> 00:47:18.900
Hey, slow down.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:21.280
Don’t drink so much.

00:47:21.328 --> 00:47:22.384
This is nothing.

00:47:22.424 --> 00:47:23.048
Nothing, my ass.

00:47:23.072 --> 00:47:24.432
You’ve downed two bottles already.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.856
If he’s drunk, you take him home.

00:47:26.888 --> 00:47:27.880
Why me?

00:47:27.912 --> 00:47:30.192
Your place is near his.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:31.890
Dao!

00:47:32.056 --> 00:47:33.600
Hey, Dao. Over here!

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:37.216
None of you answered my calls, gosh!

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.240
My phone died.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.784
Dao.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.696
What?

00:47:41.728 --> 00:47:44.280
You’re not my friend anymore.

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.480
What are you on about now?

00:47:46.504 --> 00:47:51.872
You didn’t tell me Wan was Thap’s ex.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:59.856
I didn’t want to, because I never
liked Wan that much and you’re his fan.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.272
I didn’t want you to get upset, that’s all.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.952
Why does it have to be Wan, guys?

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:07.416
Aw, easy there.

00:48:07.448 --> 00:48:10.488
Tell me, who exactly are you jealous of here?

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.976
And what about you, In?

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:18.928
Why didn’t you tell me
you were seeing my brother?

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.456
Like I had a chance to see you
and tell you in person.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.680
It should’ve been your brother who told you.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.664
He just got shot and is lying in the hospital.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:34.360
And what if your mom thinks
he got shot because I couldn’t save him?

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.552
How am I supposed to live with that?

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.023
Nobody thinks that way!

00:48:39.024 --> 00:48:41.020
Right, you’re overthinking it.

00:48:41.032 --> 00:48:42.048
Exactly.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.840
Help me knock some sense into him.

00:48:43.864 --> 00:48:45.216
I’ve already said enough.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.352
Wan is so great.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:50.664
They make a perfect match.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.968
Listen, In.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.032
How are you not perfect?

00:48:55.048 --> 00:48:56.272
True.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:58.432
Calm down.

00:48:58.472 --> 00:48:59.736
Whatever.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.760
You’re drunk.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.520
All of you, drink up.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.592
Tonight, I’m knocking you down one by one.

00:49:07.624 --> 00:49:09.392
Alright, bring it on!

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.080
Hope you’re not the first to get knocked.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.440
We’ll see.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.616
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.048
Whoa, slow down.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:26.616
What do you think it is? Water?

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:34.200
Alright, let’s switch up the mood.

00:49:34.232 --> 00:49:36.800
Who here is heartbroken? Make some noise!

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:43.176
This one’s a song from Wan Warayu.

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:45.680
Guys, I’ll be right back.

00:49:45.712 --> 00:49:47.680
Hm? Where are you going?

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.136
In?

00:49:48.176 --> 00:49:50.056
- In!
- Bro!

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.304
- Can you not play Wan’s songs?
- Calm down.

00:49:52.328 --> 00:49:53.568
Play someone else’s songs.

00:49:53.608 --> 00:49:55.456
- Sorry, my friend is drunk.
- Can you change the song?

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.056
- I’m so sorry, everyone.
- No Wan’s songs tonight!

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.672
Please enjoy your night.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.192
Tul, take care of him.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.456
No more Wan’s song.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.400
I know, I know.

00:50:05.432 --> 00:50:06.632
Be still.

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.584
Stand here. Okay.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.464
So, what’s wrong? Tell me.

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.912
I don’t know.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.832
What? Did you break up with him?

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.248
No, I didn’t.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.808
Then what?

00:50:27.288 --> 00:50:29.290
He got shot.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:32.176
Were you the one who shot him?

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.280
Damn you.

00:50:34.328 --> 00:50:36.608
Why would I shoot him?

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:39.520
I like him so damn much.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.940
That hurts.

00:50:42.376 --> 00:50:43.112
I’m out of here.

00:50:43.144 --> 00:50:45.110
Wait, Tul.

00:50:45.888 --> 00:50:47.680
Hear me out first.

00:50:52.632 --> 00:50:55.400
It’s like what happened with my parents.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:00.624
He got shot, and I couldn’t save him in time.

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:04.512
Did he die, though?

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:06.928
Tul, you asshole.

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.576
He didn’t die, did he?

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:15.648
He didn’t because you gave him a heads-up.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.848
So why beat yourself up? Hm?

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.928
When did you get here?

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.992
Right when the bar opened.

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:29.830
Dao.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.792
Thap? What are you doing here?

00:51:31.824 --> 00:51:32.824
Where’s In?

00:51:33.184 --> 00:51:34.568
In the back with Tul.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.200
Pretty wasted, I think.

00:51:36.232 --> 00:51:37.608
Where exactly?

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.840
Just head back there and you’ll see.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.464
Over there.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.392
Thanks, guys.

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:47.480
Seriously, if you like him that much,

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.608
why would you back off?

00:51:49.656 --> 00:51:51.744
You’re being silly, you know?

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.976
I’m not backing off.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:00.944
I just don’t know where I stand in his life.

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:06.230
Come again?

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.288
I heard his mom say
he should get back with Wan.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.360
And they do look like a good match.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.536
So… you’re jealous?

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:21.568
I’m not.

00:52:21.608 --> 00:52:22.608
You are.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.424
I am?

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.128
Yes.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.368
I can be?

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.240
Who’s his boyfriend here?

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:28.560
That’s me.

00:52:28.592 --> 00:52:29.592
Right?

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.768
When I see you with him, I get jealous too.

00:52:32.808 --> 00:52:34.416
I’m not even your boyfriend.

00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:38.392
Fine!

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.592
I’m jealous. I’m silly.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.744
I’m so damn unreasonable.

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.832
But you know, the day Thap got shot,

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:49.728
Wan gave him blood.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:57.032
Now Wan’s blood
is flowing, flowing, flowing in his body.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.176
Can I be jealous of blood?

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.580
Yes.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.784
You don't like that, huh?

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.920
Want me to take the blood out of him?

00:53:05.952 --> 00:53:06.560
I’ll do it for you right now.

00:53:06.592 --> 00:53:07.688
Wait.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.856
Listen first.

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.408
I don’t know, man.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.544
I’ve been without a family for so long.

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:26.848
I don’t know how much
his parents’ opinions mean to him.

00:53:28.888 --> 00:53:30.890
If it’s just Wan, I’ll fight,

00:53:32.048 --> 00:53:34.050
because I believe Thap loves me that much.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.800
But if I let his parents down again,

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.264
I won’t be able to live with myself.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:47.064
I can’t love him more than I already do.

00:53:51.408 --> 00:53:53.410
.Gosh, I’m so drunk.

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:56.220
Hey, hey.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.120
In.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.520
In.

00:54:08.816 --> 00:54:10.820
I was planning to
make a better catch than that.

00:54:10.848 --> 00:54:12.408
But he chose you.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.192
Take care of him.

00:54:20.048 --> 00:54:22.050
His weakness is family.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.696
If your family doesn’t choose him,

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:25.992
I think you should…

00:54:26.008 --> 00:54:27.008
I’ve chosen him.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.968
Don’t worry.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.208
Thanks for not actually taking my blood out.

00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.060
Sure.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:24.544
In, sit back up.

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:26.050
One, two, three.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:33.192
Good boy.

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:35.928
Are you okay?

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.048
Who are you?

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.616
Thap?

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:10.752
You’re not Thap.

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:15.200
The real Thap is in the hospital with his ex.

00:56:22.784 --> 00:56:24.780
An ex is an ex.

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.304
My boyfriend now is right here.

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:30.090
What?

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:32.872
When did I agree to that?

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.832
Then agree now.

00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:40.464
Will you be this doctor’s boyfriend,

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:42.536
Mr. Patient?

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.400
At this stage, do you still need to ask?

00:56:51.704 --> 00:56:53.700
I just want to be sure.

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400
What do you say?

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:58.630
Yes or no?

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:17.960
Thap, you are mine only.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.344
You are my boyfriend.

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:27.600
What about you, In?

00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.984
Are you mine only as well?

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.900
I don’t know.

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.056
You’re mine only.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.060
Thank you.

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:24.848
- Thank you.
- Sure, thank you.

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.968
The Moonstone is a gift for lovers.

00:59:40.992 --> 00:59:42.712
You might need this one for him.

01:00:25.128 --> 01:00:26.808
Are you going to keep
running away from me?

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.280
Don’t you miss me at all?

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.768
Will you be my boyfriend?

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:33.528
Aren’t you two going to let me
have some alone time with my boyfriend?

01:00:33.568 --> 01:00:34.808
It’s not over yet.

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:36.664
Don’t think it’s already a happy ending.

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:38.216
Should we pick some cards?

01:00:38.256 --> 01:00:41.128
I want to know who was really behind the attack.

01:00:41.168 --> 01:00:42.496
Is he the one I think he is?

01:00:42.712 --> 01:00:44.180
But they’re friends.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:47.928
You’d be surprised how little money it takes
to make people kill each other.

01:00:47.968 --> 01:00:49.528
If I really wanted to compete with you,

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.520
you’d be in an even worse position, Karn.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.820
Thap, you bastard!

01:00:53.968 --> 01:00:55.168
Why did you do it?!
