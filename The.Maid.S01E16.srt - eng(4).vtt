00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.120
(Shen Xiao, The Duke)
My lord, have a drink.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.360
Father,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.440
how can you have the leisure to drink?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.720
What else can I do?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.040
It has come to this.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.160
I can only drown my sorrows in wine.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.280
Through my mother's family connections,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.400
you rose
from a destitute scion of nobility

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.520
to a military-backed Duke.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.160
Now that she has lost power,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.320
you want to abandon her?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.040
I'll beg Pei Ji

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.000
and the Empress Dowager.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.280
Foolish.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.360
You've been married to Pei Ji for years.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.800
Can't you see

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.240
his intentions?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.800
He wants to sever our ties

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.040
with the Empress Dowager.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.112
It's all your mother's fault.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.120
She was careless in her schemes

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120
and left evidence behind.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
None of us can save her now.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.080
Everything she did

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.040
was for you and the Empress Dowager.

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:43.872
And for me.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.280
As her daughter,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.480
I can't watch her die.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.360
All her actions were for our sake.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.960
I believe she'll understand.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.360
Father.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.800
You...

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.560
What do you mean?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.680
This is the only way left.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.880
Mother!

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.080
How did you become like this?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.520
What happened?

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.440
It seems

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.600
the Empress Dowager's people
have been here.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.880
You cannot speak now.

00:04:28.032 --> 00:04:29.920
Are they shifting all blame

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.192
onto us?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.480
Father,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.560
let's bribe the jailers

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.520
and find a dead prisoner
to replace my mother.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.840
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.560
Only her death will satisfy

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.160
the Empress Dowager and Pei Ji.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.568
Only then can we escape.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.520
Darling.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.360
Darling.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.120
Darling.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.360
How you've suffered.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.320
Over the years,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.560
you've killed so many people.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.880
Whether I cared for them

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.040
or not,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.560
you let nobody escape.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.600
Call it karma cashing in what you owe.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.120
What are you gaping at?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.320
Lend a hand!

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.080
Come on!

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.160
Bad news!

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.560
The Duchess has hanged herself.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.320
Lady Yuqing,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.320
Shen Yuanjin's greatest support,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.040
Madam Su, has fallen.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.080
Empress Dowager won't protect her.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.560
But why don't you

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.680
feel any satisfaction?

Your Highness, what do you want?

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.040
Yesterday, why did you

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.680
save the Duke's household?

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.960
You know

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.160
those concubines and their daughters?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.352
I am but of lowly birth.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.120
Seeing those restless souls,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.360
I couldn't help recalling the past.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.920
I feel their sorrow as my own.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.280
Return these evidences

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.080
on my behalf.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.400
(Mother's acupuncture pouch?)

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.000
Thank you.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.840
For what?

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.400
For upholding justice.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.960
While investigating at Dali Court,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.760
I heard stories.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.440
That Shen Yuqing, who resembled you,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.800
and her mother

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.760
suffered extreme abuse

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.080
in the Duke's Mansion.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960
The Duchess

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.400
punished Qin Xiaoniang

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.080
with routine beatings.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.040
Or worse,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.400
forced naked in winter's chill.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.920
As for Lin Jifu,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320
what she enjoyed most

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.480
was abusing Shen Yuqing.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360
The two of them,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.880
one went mad,

00:10:46.352 --> 00:10:47.112
and the other mute.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.360
Four years ago,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.800
they were confined in Yangque Garden.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.600
Pecked by birds,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.120
and their palms pierced by iron chains.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.960
After that,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.760
they vanished without a trace.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.000
You pitied them?

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.120
Back then, the Empress Dowager

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.280
threatened my mother to coerce me

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.560
into quelling the Hexi rebellion.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.360
It was a suicide mission.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.960
But If I died,

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.920
no one would've protected

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.320
my mother in the Cold Palace.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.720
Your Highness...

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.480
A palace eunuch

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.960
acted on the Empress Dowager's order.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.560
He humiliated her,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.600
tormented her,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.440
and dislocated her limbs,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.680
forcing her to crawl.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.080
Every rainy night since,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.720
she suffered bone-chilling cold.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.600
Do you know

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.240
why I despise deception?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.240
My mother had chronic heart disease.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.160
Her most trusted nanny

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.520
told her

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.560
I'd perished in Hexi.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.880
The shock triggered her condition.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.800
She never saw my return

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.280
before passing away.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.080
So,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.480
you purged the harem upon returning.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.440
You became known as

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.000
the bloodthirsty

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.400
and tyrannical Prince Regent.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.640
It's not sympathy

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.000
but understanding.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.320
Yet I also have people to protect.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.880
So no matter who you are,

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.520
this ends now.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.720
- What's happening?
- It's nothing.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.360
The demoness has appeared.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.760
Chaos descends.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.400
When examined in the prison,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.920
no words were found.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.600
A cursed omen.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.920
Disaster approaches.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.680
Quick, let's go!

00:14:17.032 --> 00:14:17.920
My lady.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.800
My lady.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.320
The whole capital whispers

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.400
that you're the demoness.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.720
The Duke schemes to destroy you.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.240
Why rage?

00:14:28.232 --> 00:14:28.980
I don't believe

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.960
he hasn't heard the talk

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.160
that you are Shen Yuqing.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.800
At least he should verify

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.200
if you're truly his daughter.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.200
Daughter?

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.560
My beauty...

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.360
My lord,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.560
we're in public.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.200
Public?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.840
That makes it more thrilling!

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.400
My lord...

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.280
Come on.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.240
My lord,

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.240
someone's watching.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:58.840
Hold this.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.200
Can't even hold clothes?

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.400
Useless!
