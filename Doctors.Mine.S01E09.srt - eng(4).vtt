"Doctor's Mine"
(Episode 9)

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.944
Let's start over with me.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.456
So handsome.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.424
I know.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.464
Morning.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.336
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.456
Hurt from what?

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.712
I'm strong.

00:08:57.064 --> 00:08:59.408
This is nothing, it doesn't hurt.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.872
Last night we didn't...

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.320
Stop it, P'Knight.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.120
You're not embarrassed, but I am.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.096
Well, I'm happy.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.280
What about you?

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.240
Hmm, I'm happy too.

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.430
So we're a couple now, right?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.776
If we weren't, I wouldn't let you do this.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.032
Wait, P'Knight!

00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:15.808
Can't I get my morning reward?

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.576
But I have an early check-up.

00:10:19.256 --> 00:10:19.960
Just a sec.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.640
Please, just a sec,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.960
okay?

00:10:33.192 --> 00:10:34.632
Really quick,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.528
okay?

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.472
Fine,

00:10:43.968 --> 00:10:47.280
but... only for 10 minutes.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.232
That's not enough.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.160
Whenever.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.088
Thank you.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.608
Thank you. Bye-bye.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.960
Yay!!

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.544
Hey, P'.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.392
Hmm, thanks.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.520
By the way, there were a lot of kids today.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.168
That's good. Kids aren't good at explaining,

00:13:23.192 --> 00:13:25.352
and parents don't have time to take care of them.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.784
Let's use this opportunity to do a thorough checkup. Okay!!

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.584
Yes, it's true.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.024
Don't block him.

00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:04.296
Very good.

00:14:07.144 --> 00:14:07.984
Are you jealous?

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:10.620
Huh?! No, I'm not.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.976
Jealous of what?

00:14:12.672 --> 00:14:13.740
I'm not jealous.

00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:15.304
Are you sure?

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.720
But what about you?

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.720
Is it okay to just let P' Per go like that?

00:14:24.808 --> 00:14:27.072
Hey, it's okay, AirDrop first.

00:14:27.824 --> 00:14:29.070
Oh, My Buddha.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.088
Hey!

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.624
What are you doing, P' Kan?

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:38.968
Hey, P',

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.792
what are you doing?!

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:44.880
Hey!

00:14:44.928 --> 00:14:48.296
Oh, calm down,

00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:50.064
I was just kidding. Just messing with you.

00:15:01.632 --> 00:15:03.904
And you, let me go now.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.960
Of course, you've already taken my heart.

00:15:15.488 --> 00:15:17.490
You can crush it however you want.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.432
You know how much I cherish you.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.112
So why did you do this?

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.640
Per, why are you so serious about this?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.576
If you intended to tease me,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.360
you've succeeded.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.640
Per.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.312
Per.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.176
Per, are you really mad?

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.640
Per, come back and talk to me.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.224
Let me go P'Knight, I'm hurt.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.712
It hurts? Hey, I'm sorry.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.496
Here hurts,

00:16:10.568 --> 00:16:11.544
and here too.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.176
You're still laughing.

00:16:17.696 --> 00:16:19.184
You're so cute.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.808
My rascel.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.808
P'Knight.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.712
This is for making me jealous.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.472
And this is for being cute.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.928
You go so big.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.400
This is a bonus.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.064
P'Knight!

00:17:20.904 --> 00:17:21.616
This.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.272
Thanks.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.536
Stop overthinking.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.544
What? Who's overthinking?

00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:41.330
Go lie to your dog at home.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:44.688
Yeah,

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.592
it's only been one day.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.264
I'll get over it.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.824
Yeah, I get it.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.792
The weather's nice.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.576
I'm gonna rest my eyes for a bit.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.088
Your heart's beating so fast.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.968
You should get it checked out.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.840
Why is it so hot today?

00:19:33.208 --> 00:19:35.210
Yeah, it's really hot.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.912
I think the world is about to end.

00:20:13.664 --> 00:20:15.660
Where are you, Per!

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.584
P'Kan, aren't you going to eat?
You've been standing here for a while.

00:20:23.008 --> 00:20:25.512
I don't feel like eating. I can't find someone.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.968
P'Per?

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.352
Um.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.392
Where did he go?

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:33.960
I don't know.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.944
Hey!

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.072
You seem stressed.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.672
I can't find Per.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.920
Per is missing?

00:20:43.944 --> 00:20:44.848
Um.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.112
He caused other trouble.

00:20:48.136 --> 00:20:49.368
Natcha.

00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:51.620
What? It's true!

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.200
He causes problems everywhere.

00:20:53.224 --> 00:20:54.208
He's a real troublemaker.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:59.040
Natcha, if you're not going to help,
you can just go back.

00:21:05.952 --> 00:21:07.088
I'll handle this.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.656
No problem, P'Kan. I'll help you look for it myself.

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:18.980
Hmm, thank you so much.

00:21:37.216 --> 00:21:38.000
How is it?

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.664
It's not delicious at all, Fern.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.600
I came all this way and it was so tiring and hot,

00:21:45.248 --> 00:21:47.250
and I didn't even get to eat delicious food.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.208
Even the water isn't good.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.472
Fern,

00:22:02.008 --> 00:22:03.160
can you come with me for a while?

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.320
I have something to talk to you about.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:41.944
Sorry.

00:22:44.368 --> 00:22:46.370
What is Knight apologizing to Fern for?

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.552
I'm sorry for everything.

00:22:51.048 --> 00:22:53.608
I'm sorry that the last time we talked,
it didn't go very well.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.400
And... I wasn't really listening to what you wanted to say.

00:23:03.952 --> 00:23:05.392
I'm sorry.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.240
It's my own feelings.

00:23:09.464 --> 00:23:11.112
I have to deal with it.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.768
Never mind.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.688
But there is one thing I really want to ask you.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:30.280
If you had met me before,
would you have opened your heart to me?

00:23:33.984 --> 00:23:38.640
Even so, the person I love is still Mild, Fern.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.216
Thank you, Knight.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.504
At least you answered
what I've wanted to know for a long time.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:58.320
This makes me realize that I should stop.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.136
If I don't stop, it will be really bad.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.360
But it has to end now.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.152
What I thought wasn't real.

00:24:14.928 --> 00:24:17.984
Fern, don't blame yourself.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.544
It's okay.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.792
Thank you, Knight.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:58.344
You're acting like a heroine, beautiful with long hair.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.928
I'm not a woman, so I can't be prettier than you.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.928
Of course the original is better.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.688
The original may be the real thing,
but if it doesn't have quality, it still loses.

00:25:14.832 --> 00:25:20.336
It's a good thing my friend realized in time
that you didn't pass QC.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:20.992
Hey you!

00:25:21.024 --> 00:25:21.624
Hey!

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.960
If you keep acting like this,
you won't find someone who is sincere.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.952
Don't be so selfish.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.024
I'm telling you this for your own good.

00:25:32.056 --> 00:25:33.080
This guy!

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.960
Pat, let's go.

00:25:38.232 --> 00:25:41.920
Fern, what did Knight say to you?

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.856
Let's just go.

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:07.660
Did I really do the right thing?

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:11.976
You did great.

00:27:04.104 --> 00:27:07.080
Over, not over.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.424
Over, not over.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.160
Don't be like this. I don't want to be mad for long.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.968
Stop being mad, darling.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.344
P'Kan,

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.048
I've looked everywhere and can't find Per.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.560
Damn, where did Per go?

00:27:57.848 --> 00:27:59.504
P'Per might be lost in the woods.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.392
No way. He's not that stupid.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.432
Where the hell did he go?

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.152
Oh! Where have you been, Cha?

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.360
I went to manage something.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.144
So what happened?

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.408
Per's gone. We still can't find him.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.936
Oh! You're acting like someone died.

00:28:24.976 --> 00:28:27.272
Hey, Cha, what the hell are you saying?

00:28:27.304 --> 00:28:28.232
What did you do to him?

00:28:28.256 --> 00:28:29.424
Hey, stop it!

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.808
Your kid went missing on his own,
so don't take it out on me.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.440
Clam down, guys.

00:28:36.472 --> 00:28:38.440
I'll contact the park rangers to help.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.592
You guys split into groups of three and help search
the area around the edge of the forest.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.688
But don't go in too deep.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.792
If you find him, blow your whistle to let everyone know.

00:28:45.832 --> 00:28:48.192
Okay, Hey you guys, let's go!

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.640
Hey, I'll go with you!

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.832
No, stay here.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.736
If anything happens to P'Per,

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.776
I won't let the person who did this get away.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.928
Per!

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.528
Hey, Per.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.128
Per!

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:35.680
Per!

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.224
Hey, Per.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.152
Per!

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.408
Per.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.648
Per.

00:29:46.648 --> 00:29:47.640
Hey, Per.

00:29:57.552 --> 00:29:58.256
Hey, Per.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.968
Hey, Per.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.520
Per.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:06.400
Yes, darling.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.384
Where have you been, huh?

00:30:09.424 --> 00:30:10.936
Where have you been?

00:30:12.848 --> 00:30:14.488
Darling, I'm hurt.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.272
Per,

00:30:25.136 --> 00:30:26.472
who did this to you?

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.152
Don't fall asleep, Don't you fall asleep, Per!

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.280
Darling, are you crying?

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.440
Why are you cry? It's just a little thing.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.920
I love you, doc.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.096
Yeah, I know.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.400
Let's get treated first.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:31.240
Let's go, don't fall asleep, Per.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.968
Per... Per, don't you dare be anything... Per, Per!

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.088
Per!

00:31:59.616 --> 00:32:00.424
Per!

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.952
Per!

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.680
Per, Per!

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.160
Damn, Natcha!

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.112
Oh, stop!

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.936
She isn't the one who did it.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.600
She's the one who caught the criminal!

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.904
We heard the whistle and ran after it,

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:32.250
and we found Natcha and this kid Mayo.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.232
This kid is the one who stabbed Per.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:36.888
Mayo...

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.384
Shit, did you do this to my brother, you ass!

00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:45.710
Why did you do this, huh?

00:32:45.752 --> 00:32:47.128
Why did you do it?!

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.480
Don't you remember me, bro?

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.752
Does it hurt? Let me look at your wound.

00:33:06.512 --> 00:33:07.416
Let's see.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.672
You! Is that kid?

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.848
You know him?

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.480
I helped him when he was a kid.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.624
You remember now?

00:34:05.024 --> 00:34:08.840
Do you know how long I've been looking for you?

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.792
But when I finally found you, you already had a boyfriend.

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:17.392
So...

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:20.456
I had to get rid of him.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.800
If that Per wasn't around,
you would have been mine a long time ago.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.792
Why do you look like that?

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:11.760
Do you feel guilty?

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.832
If you had chosen me from the start,

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.624
no one would have had to get hurt.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.576
Damn it!

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.496
You see me now.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.512
Finally, you'll be mine alone.

00:35:40.376 --> 00:35:41.456
You're wrong.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.520
Even without me,

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.504
Kan would never be yours.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.208
Kan's life is his own.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:02.112
Someone like you... you only love yourself.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.472
No, no, no!

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.640
Kan is mine. He loves only me.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.456
He did it for me.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.600
No! He must be mine.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.976
We need to get Per to the hospital first.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.768
I'm sorry.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.832
Are you okay?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.280
I'm okay.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.576
Per, Per, don't you dare be anything but okay!

00:37:14.608 --> 00:37:16.784
Per, can you hear me? Per!

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.800
Hello.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.936
Oh! Please calm down, P Kalaya.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.976
If anything happens to my son,
I won't let you get away with this.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.168
But no one is at fault in this matter.

00:39:10.208 --> 00:39:11.408
It's because of him!

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.816
Because of him, my son has to be lying there.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.328
If anything happens to my son, how can I live?

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.512
How can I live?

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:21.864
Mom, mom, mom, that's enough.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.792
Mom, that's enough.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.904
I admit that I'm also partly in this matter.

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:35.500
But I'm not the one who hurt Per.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.408
And I've already promised Per that I won't leave him.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.408
I won't break my promise.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.024
I'll stay by his side.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:52.992
I won't leave Per.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.376
Mom! Mom! That's enough!

00:39:59.432 --> 00:40:01.430
Take mom outside first.

00:40:01.464 --> 00:40:02.640
Mom, come here.

00:40:49.672 --> 00:40:51.936
The patient is past the critical stage.

00:40:51.984 --> 00:40:53.560
He'll need to rest for a while.

00:40:53.592 --> 00:40:55.632
In the meantime, don't let him move too much.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.944
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

00:40:57.976 --> 00:40:59.528
Thank you, Doctor.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:00.864
I'm leaving now.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.368
My son.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.952
No matter how I tell him to leave, he won't go.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:19.600
Whose fault is it that you have to be like this!

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:21.992
That's enough.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.936
I've handled for Mayo situation.

00:41:26.976 --> 00:41:29.696
The police said they'll prosecute
the criminal to the fullest extent of the law.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:32.904
Good, son. I'll handle the rest myself.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.336
Don't worry, P'Kan.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:38.552
Thanks.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.072
He started it, but he's not helping at all.

00:41:44.096 --> 00:41:46.880
And still has nerves with his siblings around, huh!

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.712
I'm going outside to get some fresh air.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.144
Why are you letting him in?

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.400
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.968
Hey, wait for me, P'Kan!

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.352
If I stayed in there, I would've snapped at her.

00:42:12.568 --> 00:42:14.570
Per probably doesn't want that to happen.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.000
I understand.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.920
If aunt says anything about you again, I'll handle it.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:26.704
What could someone like you possibly do?

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.752
Oh, you're underestimating me.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.760
P'Per's mom or not,

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:33.944
She won't get away with it.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:40.952
P'Kan.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.272
Did you come to visit Per?

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.352
Yeah,

00:43:02.416 --> 00:43:03.608
can I go in?

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.648
His parents are still inside. Wait a moment.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:09.960
Sure.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.896
Cha,

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.560
can I talk to you for a bit?

00:44:09.472 --> 00:44:12.792
If you're not there, it would be bad.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.856
But you suspect me at first,
even though I told you I didn't do it.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:28.720
I'm sorry, Natcha.

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:31.560
I was biased.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.136
Kan, do you know?

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.900
Just you not loving me hurts so much already.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:49.960
But you didn't trust me as a friend.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:52.880
That hurts even more.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.944
I'm really sorry.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.120
If you don't want to be friends with me anymore, I...

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:14.512
I still want to be friends with you,

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.944
But... Can I have some more time?

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.448
I'll come back and be your friend again later.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:47.560
You should go back to see N'Per.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.488
Go!

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.304
If I see your face any longer, I'll change my mind.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.168
Go, go now.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.456
Go to see him.

00:46:34.496 --> 00:46:35.752
It's okay, dude.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.024
Thank you.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.352
Just keep crying.

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.120
Trouble has been cleared.
You guys can be with each other comfortably now.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:19.880
This kid...

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.560
Wake up, Per.

00:48:57.848 --> 00:48:59.850
I miss you like crazy.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.072
The prince needs to kiss Sleeping Beauty now.

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:55.920
Per!

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:59.960
Ahh Doc! That hurts.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:01.616
Sorry,

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.872
Sorry. Are you hurt?

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:18.904
Hey, Doctor, if you rub me more than this,
we won't be ending things here today.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:22.952
Per!

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:29.208
Are you crying, Doctor?

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:31.992
I'm just happy you woke up.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.144
I'm not crying.

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.968
I've seen you cry so many times.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.120
And who do you think caused it?

00:50:52.456 --> 00:50:53.472
Hey, Doctor.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.144
You still haven't told me.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.272
Tell you what?

00:51:13.112 --> 00:51:14.552
Do you love me?

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.752
Of course.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:06.176
I love you like crazy.

00:52:47.568 --> 00:52:49.968
Kan, I bought some fruit...
