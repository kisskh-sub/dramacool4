WEBVTT

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.340
We're given only a few minutes
to spend with each patient.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.241
SEVEN YEARS AGO

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:13.113
Given our uniform medical fee structure,
there have been situations

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:18.418
where we had limited time and resources
to use within those few minutes.

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.221
Our General Medicine Department

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:25.692
was established with the purpose
of "treating people, not organs."

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.262
And in the midst
of a fragmented healthcare system,

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:34.234
we are also here to reinstate
"no one gets left behind,"

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.970
our fundamental principle.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.883
I've probably said these words
around 300 times.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:53.486
If this goes on…

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:59.459
you'll end up seeing your patients
as nothing but their illness.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:07.033
And healthcare will be seen
as little more than a skill set.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.336
Hey! Are you listening to me?

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.005
Hey!

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.310
Look at me!

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.695
Blazing a trail where none existed.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:40.100
Alone on the night sea,

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:45.738
aiming for the faint glow in the distance,

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.208
I walked toward it.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.343
Oh, well!

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.746
That too will soon come to an end.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.082
Please bear with me.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.288
Dr. Akaike!

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:10.096
In Japan today,
a heart is a heart, and a lung is a lung.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.198
Categorized by organ,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.902
some patients fall
through the cracks between specialties.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:22.575
Occasionally, there are young punks
like him, hit hard by reality.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.111
I know it can't be helped.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:27.013
No one is to blame.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.415
Everyone's doing their best.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:31.784
That's true.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.388
You can't save lives with only ideals.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.223
But…

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.461
I don't know how to just give up.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.169
I want to…

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.105
care for everything.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:57.544
My patients' past and future,
from start to end.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.714
What a pretty face you have.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.249
What?

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.251
But you have scary eyes.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.623
Your brows are furrowed.

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:21.601
I want to know
what it means to examine someone.

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:24.170
Is that so?

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.173
Keep at it.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.647
Does that mean
I'm going to study under you?

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:36.482
No can do.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.251
What? Why?

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:43.656
I'm quitting this hospital.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:03.076
I took my summer vacation.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.981
Please look a little happier about it.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.417
Your beloved disciple came to visit.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.353
You…

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:19.993
shouldn't say things like that yourself.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.104
GENERAL MEDICINE

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:42.749
Dr. Takino.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.017
Oh, hello.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:46.819
I hear Dr. Tokushige
took his summer leave.

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.288
Are you okay on your own?

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.224
I'm not so sure.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.292
What?

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:53.860
But I just have to get by.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:58.731
I'd greatly appreciate it if you could
give me any advice or encouragement.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.101
- Ouch!
- You're so serious.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.805
40-year-old woman with acute gastritis.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.442
Her nausea and vomiting
improved with fasting and IV drips.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.911
We plan to follow up
with her as an outpatient.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.046
Excuse me.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:13.946
Yes.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:17.884
It says this patient
has a history of atopic dermatitis.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:20.186
Steroids?

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:21.220
Yes.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.990
Prolonged use of strong drugs,
even for external use,

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.826
may affect the digestive system
through the adrenal glands.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.861
I understand.

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:32.031
I'll also keep an eye
on her cortisol levels and blood pressure.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.067
Thank you.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.570
Any further questions?

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:39.272
Are you ready?

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.342
- Thank you very much, Dr. Kayama.
- All set.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.678
Next up, we'll hear from Dr. Umesato.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.748
{\an8}As Japan faces an increasingly
aging population,

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:51.217
and as more doctors specialize,

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.587
we wonder who will provide
comprehensive care for patients.

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.923
No one gets left behind.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.993
This facility serves
as its community's last bastion.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.130
To apply for the Ministry of Health,
Labor and Welfare's

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.399
General Practice Support Program,

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:10.002
we require the cooperation
of all nearby hospitals.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.039
I hope you'll consider aiding us.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:17.310
Dr. Kitano,
I was impressed by your speech.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.578
Thank you.

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:22.782
But in the end,
profitability is everything.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:28.388
Isn't Dr. Togo prepping hard
for the next directorial election?

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.092
No hospital has the leeway
to invest in an ideal future.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:37.697
All of them are desperately trying
to survive the reality we face today.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:43.035
{\an8}We can't cut down
on nurses due to staffing standards.

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.138
If we do away with them,

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:48.608
medical fees will go down,
while frontlines are overwhelmed.

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:54.480
Therefore, it becomes clear
which departments we must cut.

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:56.082
PEDIATRICS
GENERAL MEDICINE

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.819
We need to take action
before things get really out of hand.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:10.263
Why did you decide to get rid of them?

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:11.464
What?

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.166
The books.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.169
You sent so many of them to us.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:22.074
Don't talk as though my gift was trash.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.813
I'm shutting down my clinic.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.848
You can tell by looking around.

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:36.222
There's a bridge that's going
to connect to the other island.

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:40.793
That's true,
they have a hospital there, too.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.865
The ferries run frequently.

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:50.336
In an emergency,
Uotora will send someone out.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.042
So, this place isn't needed anymore?

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.779
You catch on quick,
my fellow general practitioner.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.350
I'm just going to take it slow
and do some fishing.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:09.255
That sounds too cliché and boring to me.

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:13.659
There's nothing cute about you, is there?

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.439
Help me out with this.

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:28.708
Okay.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.986
That's a lot of books.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.487
Dr. Kojiro.

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:45.992
- Just letting you know I'm here.
- Sorry, I didn't notice you.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:51.364
I'm sorry, but Dr. Tokushige
is not here today.

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:56.335
I know.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.106
Yum!

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.140
Yeah.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.678
This shaved ice is so fluffy.

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:07.613
Yeah.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.681
Yum!

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:15.488
Back in the day, the ice machine
ones were all crunchy, but these are…

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:17.623
pure ice.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:24.230
Access here has really improved.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.100
Hardly anything has changed, though.

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.704
Well, it's a slow process.

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:33.573
Dr. Red Beard!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.609
Oh? Why, thank you.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:39.412
Welcome back, Young Doctor.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.847
It's been a long time.

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.552
How's your back?

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:50.690
All good, thanks to you.
I see why they call you Dr. Red Beard.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:53.793
Mari, did your hernia come back?

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:56.762
Yeah, I'm surprised you remembered!

00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:00.600
Still pushing yourself
carrying heavy stuff, aren't you?

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:04.236
You need to be careful!
Hernias are easily recurring.

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:05.638
Use a hand truck instead.

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:09.208
I got told off again.
It's like he never left!

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:15.181
He cared for my grandma
right until the very end.

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:16.415
Sayoko…

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.786
She made such a fuss at first,
refusing to eat.

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:24.156
Whether it was peritonitis
or intestinal obstruction,

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.792
he worked hard to diagnose her.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.528
However, in the end…

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.332
it turned out to be constipation.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:40.906
I apologize
for the inconvenience I caused.

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.342
You know, Grandma was too ashamed

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:46.512
to tell the young doctor
about her bowel movements!

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:47.947
Oh, my.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.719
Sometimes, patients lie.

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:58.224
You were handed a good lesson back then.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:00.426
Yes.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:04.363
The passion fruits. You know
who told me they're rich in fiber?

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.265
- It was the young doctor here!
- Yeah!

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.834
I even gave them a try myself…

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:12.838
A 53-year-old man
diagnosed with a myocardial infection,

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.707
severe stenosis at the LAD artery.

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:18.344
PCI was unfeasible
due to severe calcification,

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.913
making a CABG
the appropriate intervention.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:26.285
It's an authentic, orthodox case study
you'd find at the beginning of a textbook.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:29.822
The anastomotic site must be handled well
due to strong calcification.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.123
Cardiac enzymes?

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.091
Confirmed.

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:34.493
Both troponin and CK-MB
are within the normal range.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.394
Correct.

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:36.595
Kidneys are doing fine.

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:39.231
I expect the surgery
will proceed as scheduled.

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:43.069
So…

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:46.972
why is Dr. Takino in our Surgical meeting?

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.176
Get out of here, amateur.

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:53.679
I heard the patient
is very anxious about the surgery.

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:56.248
I decided to have General Medicine
sit in on this session.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:11:59.151
Fine.

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:01.120
- Hey, Seto.
- Yes?

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:03.389
- I'll ensure your surgery isn't moved.
- Okay.

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:06.826
I think Dr. Toda
should perform the surgery.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.161
What?!

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.233
What are you trying to do?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:20.106
Dr. Toda has assisted you
in numerous surgeries to date,

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.375
having gained skills
and knowledge along the way.

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:25.344
I know that!

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.814
You and I will both be
present during the surgery.

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:30.583
His support system is all set.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:32.485
I know that too!

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:36.322
He still needs veteran supervision
for the safety of the patient.

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:40.192
So, there should be no problems.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.931
I was planning…

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.568
on suggesting he do it.

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:55.107
In that case, I apologize.

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.546
Why'd you butt in?

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:06.786
I can't let you run Cardio
like a one-man show forever.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.754
What?

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:13.125
This is necessary for the sake
of Uotora's entire surgical department.

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:18.464
I hope you understand.

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:23.636
That spoiled brat looked down on me!

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.672
What sharp tongue you have, Queen.

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.207
My apologies.

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:29.975
My adrenaline's pumping.

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:32.144
I feel alive!

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:35.414
Looks like Toda's in trouble.

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:39.852
Between the Queen of Hearts
and the Prince of Surgery,

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.087
let's see whose side he'll be on.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.989
Sounds like a Harry Potter title.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:45.724
- You're right!
- Stop it.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:47.827
Mess around, and sparks will fly our way.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:52.598
As things stand, there's a waiting list
for Cardio surgeries.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.733
Wouldn't this be a good opportunity?

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:58.971
Keep shrugging things off,
and you'll get invaded.

00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:01.707
This is my penalty
for defying the Head of Surgery.

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.275
Penalty?

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:06.712
Daddy's little plaything
is coming for you too!

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.248
- I'm scared.
- Is that really the case?

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:11.951
Excuse me.

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:18.858
Dr. Kojiro came to ask for my help
in trying to relax the patient.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:22.828
I don't think he's following
instructions from Dr. Togo.

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:23.929
You're toast.

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:26.465
- What?
- The General Medicine Department.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.667
He'll try while Dr. Tokushige's away.

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:33.505
Do you know what's at the top
of Dr. Togo's campaign agenda?

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:34.907
Cost-cutting.

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:37.877
Yes, he'll shut down
unprofitable departments.

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:43.015
He'll cut out the dead weight,
exactly like what a surgeon does best.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:44.717
I'll report you.

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.886
I could use some healing!

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:48.420
- She's right.
- Adorable…

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:50.856
Pediatrics could be on the line tomorrow.

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:52.992
This feels great…

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:57.296
DEAR KITANO
I CLOSED MY CLINIC, IT'S ALL UP TO YOU NOW

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.264
GET ALONG - AKAIKE

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.832
"Get along"?

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.680
Are Kitano and Togo on speaking terms?

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.584
It's hard to say.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.324
Neither side is willing to compromise.

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:31.797
Why don't the three
of you go out for a meal?

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.066
No, thanks.

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:39.338
Isn't this where you step in
as their senior?

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.375
I'm a retired old man.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:46.078
Why should I get involved?

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:47.813
Oh, boy.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.505
Come sit over here.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:23.482
The soil is a treasure trove
of life cycles.

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.589
Plop.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.658
Better sprout out soon.

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:34.526
There you go!

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:35.894
All right…

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:39.431
All done.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.768
Grow well!

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:48.607
Grow well!

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:56.915
Toda.

00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:58.517
Excuse me for a bit.

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:01.153
I wanted to talk to you
before meeting the patient.

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:03.555
You shouldn't sit there.

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:04.590
Why?

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.659
It's Dr. Chayasaka's special seat.

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.030
I dozed off on it the other day.

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:25.077
You've been practicing a lot, right?

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:26.512
Yeah.

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:31.216
It's daunting, right?

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.718
It is.

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:37.356
Dr. Chayasaka will kill me if I mess up.

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:38.791
That's what you're scared of?

00:17:38.857 --> 00:17:41.960
- Your patient deserves more concern--
- I'm kidding!

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:45.197
You haven't changed at all.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:50.436
I guess that's just how I seem to you.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.141
I really am scared.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.812
It's one blood vessel.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.683
Yet this one stitch
can decide someone's life.

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:09.421
Thinking of it makes me want to bail.

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.391
Even so…

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.094
you're still practicing.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.402
- Getting off work?
- Hey.

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.303
Here.

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:26.872
Is Toda scared?

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.608
So you were worried?

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:34.680
I'd like to see that elite
cry his eyes out.

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:38.917
"Doctors cannot afford to slip up.

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:43.188
Neither can they afford to stop."

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:47.259
I couldn't say I understood his situation.

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:51.063
But I do think about it.

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:55.801
I wonder what Dr. Tokushige would do.

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.558
Is anyone here?

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:56.695
What is it?

00:19:57.596 --> 00:20:00.032
He suddenly came out in a fever.

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.134
- This way, ma'am.
- Okay.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.936
- Here we go.
- Have a seat.

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:05.971
Hang on. There you go.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.607
Good evening. Nice to meet you.

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:12.177
Say, "Ah." Can I see your throat?

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:14.246
Oh, my.

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.515
Excuse me. Come on…

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.288
It's okay, kid.

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.124
He's a doctor.

00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:27.192
Look.

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.596
He's my top disciple.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:34.233
Say, "Ah."

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:36.268
- Ah!
- Great job!

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:38.103
Say, "Ah."

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:39.871
Breathe in.

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:42.374
Okay.

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:46.511
It's a little red, but it's not so bad.

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:48.880
I'll get you some meds.

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:50.249
Thank you.

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:55.554
Hey, you did great.

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:56.655
Yeah.

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:00.559
Good boy.

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.531
I wonder how the election's going.

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.868
Be it Dr. Kitano or Dr. Togo,

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.437
whoever wins will mean
lots of changes will be made.

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:14.373
I don't think anything will change.

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:20.746
Dr. Tenpaku,
sorry to disturb you on your break.

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:22.247
I need your advice.

00:21:25.183 --> 00:21:28.754
Mr. Otai, who's scheduled for bypass
surgery, is feeling extremely anxious.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.122
You need a prescription?

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:32.491
No, it's not that.

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:36.495
Before the pre-op consultation,
I'd like some psychiatric insights.

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:46.071
Dr. Takino, you did judo, right?

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.306
Yes.

00:21:47.372 --> 00:21:48.840
I did karate.

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:50.676
I'm a black belt.

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:52.611
Really?

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:55.213
Sorry. Carry on.

00:21:56.581 --> 00:22:02.688
People have many sides
they simply haven't shown yet.

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:10.929
Some things they know themselves
and some things they don't.

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:15.534
Some things they'll say
to protect themselves.

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:20.405
Patients sometimes lie.

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:27.212
But those lies,
those anxieties are part of them.

00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:33.919
Unlike surgeons,
we psychiatrists cannot simply cut out

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:37.856
the faulty part of the brain
that's causing the distress.

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:41.626
Therefore,

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.296
I'm all for it…

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:47.933
communicating with patients.

00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:51.603
Go for it!

00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:54.706
Yessir!

00:22:58.443 --> 00:23:02.013
Dr. Takino must be lonely right about now.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.182
I'm not sure about that.

00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:07.552
It's nice when the boss isn't around.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.188
I'm glad.

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:12.791
She also…

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:17.429
has the same "I can't give up" look.

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:24.102
Nice to meet you.

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:27.239
I'm Dr. Mizuki Takino
from General Medicine.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.811
My apologies for troubling you all
when it's just a simple surgery.

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:36.181
It's we who should apologize.

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:38.617
We want to understand
your symptoms together.

00:23:40.719 --> 00:23:43.989
How is your chest pain
and shortness of breath?

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:45.056
Well…

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:49.194
Nothing but the occasional twinge.

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:51.129
- I see, twinges.
- Yes.

00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:54.299
But not all the time.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.903
Walking leaves me out of breath.

00:23:57.969 --> 00:24:02.073
This breathlessness
must be really hard on you.

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:07.245
To be frank,
I thought of not getting this surgery.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.284
But I've heard that
Dr. Chayasaka is a superb surgeon.

00:24:16.087 --> 00:24:18.557
I didn't expect someone
so young to be assigned…

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.866
I'm sorry if I sound like I'm complaining.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.703
They call people like this
"monster patients," right?

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.604
Of course not.

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:34.639
No patient is a monster to us.

00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:41.746
Mr. Otai, you must have felt uneasy
about coming here today, right?

00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:46.885
The whiteness of the hospital
can make you nervous.

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:51.189
Besides, you're here
because you're in pain.

00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:53.892
I'm ashamed to admit this…

00:24:56.027 --> 00:24:59.431
but I thought I would feel more reassured

00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:03.401
after hearing doctors
tell me I would be okay.

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:07.372
The heart is the center of the body.

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:11.810
We understand the gravity
of making an incision there.

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:20.085
Operating while my heart is stopped,
what does that mean?

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:22.954
Well…

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:24.990
I'm sorry!

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:30.195
Patients like me who do their research
online are hard to deal with, right?

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:31.530
Oh, no.

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:34.132
But of course,

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:38.436
unreliable info that needlessly
stirs up anxiety is annoying.

00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:41.373
Exactly! It's infuriating.

00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:42.707
Doctor!

00:25:42.774 --> 00:25:44.042
It's true, right?

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:46.611
Each person's heart

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:52.384
has it's own shape
and blood vessel thickness…

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:56.788
No two are the same.

00:25:58.423 --> 00:26:01.159
I see. That makes sense.

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:04.696
Mr. Otai.

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:10.902
What would you like
to do after your surgery?

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:17.309
Go on a trip.

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:18.476
A trip?

00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:20.912
Yes, with my wife.

00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:22.280
Where?

00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:24.549
The sea, perhaps.

00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:26.418
- Wow!
- Yeah.

00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:27.786
Get some fishing done.

00:26:27.852 --> 00:26:30.956
Sounds nice!
I also have an island I want to visit.

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.059
Dr. Toda.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:40.198
After your surgery,

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:43.435
I believe that you will breathe
much more comfortably than now.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.406
You'll also be less anxious
about being on a ship.

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:52.210
Even if you fill your lungs
with the scent of the tide,

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:54.346
it shouldn't make you suffer anymore.

00:26:56.514 --> 00:27:01.086
Stopping the heart is a necessary
procedure to prevent injury.

00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:06.658
While your heart is stopped, the CPB
will fully support your whole body.

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:13.131
We are all going to protect you, Mr. Otai.

00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:23.208
I'm in your care.

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:37.055
Looking at the sea,
I'm reminded of Sayoko.

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:41.159
She succumbed to pneumonia.

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:44.963
It made her cold worse.

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:50.568
She was always looking out
for you with a smile.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.737
She was a kind soul.

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:03.882
If only…

00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:09.087
I had listened more.

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:12.991
If only…

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:20.165
we had spoken more.

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:27.672
Those words you once told me…

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.476
I still remember them.

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:38.983
"Doctors cannot do anything

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.786
without being asked.

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:47.292
But, if someone
were to come looking for you…

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:53.164
no matter who they are,
never dismiss them.

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:58.136
Listen to them intently.

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:05.643
Empathize, and gently embrace them."

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:16.921
"Tokushige!

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.994
Just like this vast ocean.

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.266
A doctor who will accept anything…

00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:32.403
that's what you need to become!"

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:47.786
Like this, you stand before the sea…

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:53.324
Splash!

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:57.162
And splash!

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:05.603
The sound of the waves crashing
mask the sound of everything else!

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:21.219
The sound of insects rubbing their wings.

00:30:27.192 --> 00:30:29.627
The birds, chirping merrily.

00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:34.299
The wind…

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:39.637
rustling through the grass.

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:47.745
The vehicles rushing past.

00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:51.649
The chatter of people!

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:05.096
Everything from A to Z blends together.

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:16.341
It's so round!

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:19.577
Tokushige!

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.458
I'm going home.

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:37.996
Dyed in orange.

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:47.338
You're not going to watch the sunset?

00:31:49.507 --> 00:31:50.775
Until the sun disappears?

00:31:51.342 --> 00:31:52.877
No.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.515
Because it's sad.

00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:08.927
"If you're flustered, speak up."

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:11.129
"Suturing is about rhythm, not speed."

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:15.700
My Queen! How nice of you.

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:18.102
Noblesse oblige.

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:21.272
Those in charge have duties to fulfill.

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:26.210
That's how we were raised too.

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:38.356
I'm so sorry for getting you involved.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.491
It's okay.

00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:45.763
Even though Dr. Takino and Dr. Chayasaka
have done so much for me,

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:47.432
I'm still anxious.

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:54.305
A doctor this scared
probably isn't qualified to handle

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:56.774
patients' bodies?

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:00.945
I don't quite get it.

00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:02.080
What?

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:04.749
"It's my first time,
but I think I'll do fine."

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:10.254
I cannot imagine entrusting myself
to a doctor who says that.

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:16.995
Dr. Chayasaka
will attend your surgery too,

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:22.400
because there is no such thing
as a surgery where failure is an option.

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.814
It's a common expression.

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:39.083
Yes.

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.587
You are not alone.

00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:46.491
That's my opinion.

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:15.720
Let me confirm
one more time, just to be sure.

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:20.291
Nothing of note in your anesthesia
history, and no particular allergies?

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:21.225
Correct.

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:24.595
So, I'll explain how things
will go on the day.

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:25.930
Excuse me.

00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:29.934
I may have agreed,
but I'm not mentally prepared.

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:34.372
General anesthesia, loss of consciousness…

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:40.111
So, can I change it to local anesthesia?

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:43.047
Local anesthesia won't cover all the pain.

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:44.482
You'll also be on CPB.

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:48.352
Mr. Otai.

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:51.889
Dr. Osu is very skilled.

00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:58.963
He's the anesthesiologist Dr. Chayasaka
always uses and trusts the most.

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:02.567
Is she going to be there?

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:03.468
Yes.

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:06.037
Do you like Dr. Chayasaka?

00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:07.605
No, I didn't mean that!

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:10.475
Oh, no. Your heart rate's going up.

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:12.543
Let's check your blood pressure.

00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:15.780
Sorry about that.

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:17.014
What?

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:19.717
I've never been good at talking to people.

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:25.423
I became an anesthesiologist
because patients are quiet then.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.525
You shouldn't say that.

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:31.896
So, I'm impressed by
what General Medicine does.

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:38.870
Good luck.

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:42.907
You too, Dr. Osu.

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:54.585
Blood pressure at 110, pulse rate at 72.

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:56.287
No problems.

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:57.955
Left ITA?

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.790
Bypass to the LAD artery is complete.

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:02.827
with a graft angle under 30 degrees.
Blood flow has been confirmed.

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:07.031
Electrosurgical unit,
suctions, surgical clips?

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:08.799
All accounted for.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.614
Toda.

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:25.249
Yes?

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:27.385
You and I couldn't be more different.

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.854
That's why I'm training you.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.693
Be delicate, but…

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:38.896
go all out.

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:41.899
I will.

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:47.838
Let's do this.

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:49.707
Go ahead.

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:51.642
Scalpel…

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:01.385
Wow, you doctors have peers too?

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.521
- Yeah, we were interns together.
- Oh, my.

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.057
Welcome!

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:07.358
You're late.

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:09.160
Will you have a beer?

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:10.828
No, I'll just have oolong.

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:13.931
Come on! We finally got together.

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:16.133
You never know when they'll call.

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:19.937
I see. That's the level of professionalism

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:22.240
that comes from performing
your own surgery.

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:26.811
You internals are lucky
not having to do all that.

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.880
Hey, you know what?

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:33.451
This is your last chance
to apologize to me.

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:36.287
- All right, bottoms up!
- Yes!

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:40.291
To our future Dr. Red Beards. Cheers!

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:41.192
Thank you.

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:42.927
This is a bit embarrassing!

00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:46.497
Dr. Takino, it's great having pals.

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:49.233
Make the best out of it.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.601
I will.

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.738
Who knew we'd meet up like this again.

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:54.639
Yeah.

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:57.074
I even forgot about the other departments.

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:02.146
I thought no one would ever listen to us.

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:06.550
If we initiated a conversation,
maybe things could change.

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:12.290
What are you trying to do?

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:15.726
What the hell are you doing,
stepping out of your domain?

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:18.529
Teaming up with General Medicine?

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:22.466
Were you even listening to me?

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:24.402
I listened to your every word.

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:28.572
With that said…

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.574
So, you're betraying me?

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.513
Fine! Leave me alone.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:38.916
Father.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.885
Get out.

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.229
- Is Dr. Tokushige taking the ferry?
- Yeah.

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.531
That takes forever.

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:55.299
He should be setting off soon.

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:57.568
- Will he bring back souvenirs?
- I'm not sure.

00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:59.337
Oh, really?

00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:00.404
What?

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.941
Dr. Kojiro.

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:09.547
{\an8}Before we move on, we have
good news to share with everyone.

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:12.850
{\an8}Returning to the show as of today…

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:15.753
{\an8}Welcome back, Mr. Hotta!

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.987
{\an8}Thank you.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.825
{\an8}It's been a long time.

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:22.326
{\an8}It's Mr. Hotta.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.562
{\an8}I'm Yoshikazu Hotta.

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:28.099
{\an8}I get a little hoarse
when I speak for too long.

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:32.803
{\an8}So lately, I've been trying
to speak with my whole body…

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.873
{\an8}WELCOME BACK MR. HOTTA

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.576
{\an8}…looking straight
at those I want to reach.

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:45.316
{\an8}I'm so delighted to see you all again.

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:02.032
{\an8}When's your ferry?

00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:04.902
{\an8}At 2:00 p.m.

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:22.353
What is it?

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.088
Take this.

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:29.293
{\an8}I don't need it anymore.

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:33.798
{\an8}It's going to leave without you.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.604
{\an8}Doctor.

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:42.740
{\an8}Go.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.978
{\an8}Dr. Akaike…

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:56.654
{\an8}I have nothing else to say to you.

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.536
I'm sorry, but…

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:16.507
Doctor.

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:19.143
I'm a doctor.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:26.750
I still have something
to speak with you about.

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.687
Your ferry's leaving.

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:37.828
The books you suddenly sent me.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.032
Your notes for Dr. Takino.

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:49.139
I told you, I'm closing down my clinic.

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:53.177
Also…

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:57.748
the way you're covering
your lower right rib.

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:03.053
It's not back pain or a hernia.

00:42:05.556 --> 00:42:07.057
That's where…

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:13.464
the liver is.

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.901
When did it start hurting, I wonder?

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:21.705
It happens when you get old.

00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:25.476
"Sometimes, patients lie."

00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:31.916
You're the one who taught me that.

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:50.401
Counting your breaths per 15 seconds.

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:55.339
Three breaths
while lying down is perfectly fine.

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.441
But…

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:04.315
at six breaths
while seated, the pacing goes up.

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:06.750
And on your abdomen…

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:20.564
several bluish veins run vertically.

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:25.135
You saw them?

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:32.876
I knew it.

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:43.287
We won't know
without a thorough examination.

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:46.423
However…

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:54.031
the most likely diagnosis
at this point is…

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:08.012
Budd-Chiari syndrome.

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:09.613
Leave!

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:15.919
This could kill you.

00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:24.361
So, please, Doctor.

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:30.200
Please tell me…

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:34.905
the truth.

00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:37.775
I won't!

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:46.116
I won't… tell you!

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:56.226
Doctor!

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.228
Dr. Akaike!

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:13.811
I'm Dr. Tokushige from General Medicine.
Requesting emergency transport.

00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:17.147
A male in his 70s,
suspected obstructive shock.

00:45:17.948 --> 00:45:20.851
{\an8}Can I request a helicopter?

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:24.888
