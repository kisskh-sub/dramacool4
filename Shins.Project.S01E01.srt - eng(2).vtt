00:01:05.964 --> 00:01:07.034
(Episode 1)

00:01:07.094 --> 00:01:08.094
(No urinating)

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.244
Hi, Si On.

00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:24.244
(Milk)

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:31.924
Let's hurry. Okay, I'm coming.

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:34.494
- Hurry up. - What in the world is going on?

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:35.724
That's Jeong Min's house.

00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:38.224
No, I think it's Mi Jin's place. No, it looks like Jeong Min's.

00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:40.434
What if there's a fire? What are we going to do?

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:42.764
What's that guy doing? He's the semi-basement guy, right?

00:01:42.864 --> 00:01:44.164
He was robbed again?

00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:48.804
Get out of the way!

00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:52.014
- Get lost, all of you! - Isn't that gasoline?

00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:58.514
- Hey, what are we going to do? - Get lost.

00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:00.354
Why are you all ignoring me!

00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:03.984
(Bathroom)

00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:05.254
Get lost.

00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:10.224
(City Gas)

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:12.394
Everyone, step back.

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:30.444
(Suyeong Express)

00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:32.454
(Milk)

00:02:38.054 --> 00:02:40.854
Everyone, get lost! I'm going to kill myself!

00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:43.494
- Choi, handle crowd control there. - What did I do wrong?

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:44.564
All right.

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:48.264
- Everyone, back up. It's dangerous. - Get out of the way, cops!

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.734
Please follow our instructions, everyone.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:51.564
Calm down, sir.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.004
- Seriously, how many times now? - Are you going to get lost or not?

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:55.644
- We understand, so... - You want to see me die?

00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:57.474
- Stop this and come on down! - Get lost!

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:58.574
Unbelievable.

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:02.384
- When's the SWAT team getting here? - They're almost here.

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:07.954
(Gas)

00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:10.254
What's that? Isn't that a butane canister?

00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:12.154
Oh, no.

00:03:12.454 --> 00:03:13.454
Hey, push them back.

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:19.834
All units, move in. Let's go, let's go.

00:03:20.264 --> 00:03:22.164
- Get in position. - Get in position.

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:24.434
(SWAT)

00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:48.124
- Get ready. - Yes, sir.

00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:54.894
What is all this? Why is it so damn noisy!

00:03:56.564 --> 00:03:57.864
- Hey! - What?

00:03:57.934 --> 00:03:59.674
You jerk! Get down from there now!

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:02.344
No! What have you ever done for me?

00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:06.014
- How many times have I told you... - Look at this. What a mess.

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:08.884
What have you ever done for me? Who are you to talk to me?

00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:09.984
I'm going to end it all.

00:04:10.044 --> 00:04:12.914
What right? You're lowering home values, punk!

00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:16.184
Why do you ignore me? Is it too much to ask?

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.424
Excuse me.

00:04:21.624 --> 00:04:24.094
Let me just hang this laundry.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.504
The elderly lady on the third floor has bad knees,

00:04:31.764 --> 00:04:34.034
so I brought it up here for her.

00:04:35.704 --> 00:04:37.074
Just going to hang the laundry.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.314
Don't.

00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:45.654
Them?

00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:49.224
Don't you worry about that. They won't shoot you anyway.

00:04:49.754 --> 00:04:54.154
The utility pipes here are ancient,

00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:57.894
this whole area will be basically one big minefield, you see.

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:01.764
- See that fire truck over there? - What?

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:02.834
The fire truck.

00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:06.774
There's a firefighter next to that truck, right?

00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:08.474
Take a good look at the hose...

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:10.404
that firefighter's holding.

00:05:12.514 --> 00:05:13.614
That's right, that one.

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.384
That hose is taut, isn't it?

00:05:17.644 --> 00:05:20.414
It's full of water. They're ready to spray immediately.

00:05:22.984 --> 00:05:26.854
So what I'm saying is, no matter how hard you try to die,

00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:29.024
it's not going to be that easy.

00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:33.494
If you can't even manage to die, why try setting yourself on fire?

00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:35.864
Mister.

00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:38.464
- Do you like chocolate milk? - What?

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:40.304
- Chocolate milk. - Choco...

00:05:40.604 --> 00:05:44.744
I bought this for myself, but have some. Just save me a little.

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:48.884
You've been working all night, so you haven't eaten a thing.

00:05:49.384 --> 00:05:51.144
Your stomach must be killing you.

00:05:51.644 --> 00:05:53.254
Here, have some.

00:05:57.224 --> 00:05:58.224
Go on, drink up.

00:06:00.554 --> 00:06:01.554
Mister!

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:05.264
Yes?

00:06:05.994 --> 00:06:06.994
Who are you?

00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:10.664
You know Ttoli Super?

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.074
- Tto... - Ttoli Super.

00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:14.134
Over there...

00:06:14.404 --> 00:06:15.644
So you do know it.

00:06:16.874 --> 00:06:18.974
You know Samgwang Villa next to it, right?

00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:21.744
- Over there. That one. - Hey!

00:06:22.044 --> 00:06:23.814
- You jerk! - What?

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:25.244
- Get down from there right now! - Keep it up.

00:06:25.314 --> 00:06:29.184
If you want to die, do it quietly! Why make a scene at my building?

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:30.724
A scene?

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:33.594
After everything you put me through in this building!

00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:35.353
It's my building. I'll do what I want.

00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:37.524
Who are you to tell me what to do?

00:06:37.594 --> 00:06:38.594
Hey, you punk!

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:41.564
It's not like we stayed for free.

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:43.604
You took our rent money on time every single month,

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:46.674
so why do you suddenly pull a stunt like this?

00:06:46.804 --> 00:06:49.874
What, you think your tenants are just a bunch of pushovers?

00:06:50.174 --> 00:06:51.174
What's wrong with you?

00:06:51.604 --> 00:06:53.114
What's he going on about? Is he telling me to leave?

00:06:53.174 --> 00:06:54.774
Who on earth are you to be causing trouble here?

00:06:54.844 --> 00:06:59.114
I tried to be patient with the geezer, but he's just ridiculous.

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:03.124
Me? I pay rent, so I'll make a scene.

00:07:03.684 --> 00:07:06.724
- So what are you gonna do about it? - You're what?

00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:11.524
Sir, please calm down for a moment. Let's step aside so you can tell me.

00:07:11.594 --> 00:07:14.194
- Get off me! I said, let go! - Please calm down.

00:07:14.264 --> 00:07:18.974
So arrogant over a single building. Hey, don't you pay him any mind.

00:07:19.034 --> 00:07:20.634
Just completely ignore a guy like that.

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:22.704
Just ignore him.

00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:24.503
- Mister. - Yes?

00:07:24.504 --> 00:07:26.114
You pay monthly rent, too?

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:29.084
You bet I do. I even have to pay rent in advance.

00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:31.444
My landlord...

00:07:32.044 --> 00:07:34.714
once threw all my stuff out onto the street.

00:07:36.324 --> 00:07:39.294
Just because I was a week late with my prepaid rent.

00:07:39.394 --> 00:07:41.824
I even ended up paying him back with interest.

00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:43.994
So disgusting and petty of him. Seriously.

00:07:48.194 --> 00:07:49.204
Buddy.

00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:54.304
I know exactly how you feel. Whatever you've been through,

00:07:54.734 --> 00:07:55.744
I swear,

00:07:56.544 --> 00:07:58.744
I am 100 percent on your side.

00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:03.784
Don't cry.

00:08:04.214 --> 00:08:06.814
Come on, don't cry over something like this.

00:08:11.354 --> 00:08:12.424
Move.

00:08:12.894 --> 00:08:13.894
I said, move!

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:15.694
Oh, good grief.

00:08:15.864 --> 00:08:18.794
Hey! Don't just stand there, shoot him!

00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:22.534
What? More nonsense?

00:08:22.604 --> 00:08:24.204
Go on, say it.

00:08:24.364 --> 00:08:27.134
I hope you spend your life living under someone else's roof...

00:08:27.204 --> 00:08:30.444
and get robbed of every cent you earn, you jerk!

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:32.574
Why you...

00:08:35.244 --> 00:08:39.854
Has that old jerk lost his mind? He's really making me angry.

00:08:39.914 --> 00:08:40.914
What did you just say?

00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:42.484
I'm seriously...

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:45.324
Don't.

00:08:45.694 --> 00:08:48.954
I'm going to burn this whole damn place to the ground,

00:08:50.994 --> 00:08:53.434
- and leave you with nothing! - He's lost it.

00:08:53.494 --> 00:08:56.404
I'll make you spend your entire life living under someone else's roof!

00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:59.574
- I swear I will! - Stop it.

00:08:59.904 --> 00:09:00.904
Hey.

00:09:01.434 --> 00:09:03.104
- Don't you dare. - No.

00:09:03.174 --> 00:09:05.174
- Let's all die! Die! - Don't! Stop it

00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:07.374
Die.

00:09:07.744 --> 00:09:09.214
After we all die together,

00:09:09.944 --> 00:09:11.744
and go to the afterworld...

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.084
Wait a second.

00:09:13.984 --> 00:09:16.854
Let's see who becomes the brighter star.

00:09:17.684 --> 00:09:18.823
Come on in!

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:20.724
- Come on in! - Stay back! No, stay back!

00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:22.354
- Come on! - You can't come in.

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:23.424
Come on!

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:28.564
Come on!

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:29.904
Go!

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:36.804
(SWAT)

00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:40.244
Mister.

00:09:40.744 --> 00:09:43.514
- Yes. - Thanks for the chocolate milk.

00:09:47.384 --> 00:09:48.384
Coming through.

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:08.934
(Police)

00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:10.404
Thanks to you, it all worked out.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:13.374
By the way, why did you break that window?

00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:15.844
I smelled gas. Didn't you?

00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:21.254
That could've caused an explosion, so I was just airing it out.

00:10:23.084 --> 00:10:26.854
He apparently wouldn't install bars, so he's been robbed three times.

00:10:28.024 --> 00:10:30.264
To make such a fuss over just some security bars, honestly.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.434
What do you mean, "just some security bars"?

00:10:32.964 --> 00:10:34.694
"Just some security bars"?

00:10:36.064 --> 00:10:39.374
Do you know why people snap?

00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:41.803
Because it all just boils up inside.

00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:43.404
It boils and boils till it spills out,

00:10:43.474 --> 00:10:46.714
and that's when the lid just blows right off.

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:50.844
Someone gets dumped, they jump. Their grades drop, they jump.

00:10:50.914 --> 00:10:52.914
They jump because the person upstairs won't stop stomping around.

00:10:53.714 --> 00:10:58.154
But I've never seen anyone jump for world peace.

00:10:59.554 --> 00:11:02.224
Do you know why people risk their lives over such small things?

00:11:02.864 --> 00:11:06.194
Because for them, that's the most urgent thing in their life.

00:11:06.764 --> 00:11:09.404
It's a matter of life and death for them!

00:11:09.834 --> 00:11:11.404
How dare you be so dismissive!

00:11:14.334 --> 00:11:15.604
Wait, sir.

00:11:16.244 --> 00:11:17.244
What?

00:11:17.904 --> 00:11:19.644
If you don't mind my asking, what is it you do?

00:11:20.344 --> 00:11:21.344
Me?

00:11:25.784 --> 00:11:27.814
Well, I'm this kind of person.

00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:30.124
If there's ever a reward,

00:11:30.984 --> 00:11:32.424
be sure to give me a call.

00:11:40.164 --> 00:11:42.904

(Shin's Project)

00:12:07.454 --> 00:12:10.664
I'm so nervous. It's our first day. Where do you think you'll be posted?

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:12.264
I'm not sure.

00:12:13.164 --> 00:12:15.164
Judge Cho will get a good post, wont he?

00:12:15.364 --> 00:12:17.004
Of course. He graduated at the top of his class.

00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:19.204
Well, I'm just going to work hard no matter which department I get.

00:12:21.604 --> 00:12:22.874
- Hello, sir. - Hello, sir.

00:12:22.944 --> 00:12:24.504
- Hello, sir. - Hello, sir.

00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:27.474
- You're my role model, sir. - Me too.

00:12:30.014 --> 00:12:31.914
You must be Cho Pillip.

00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:34.954
Yes, sir.

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:36.524
Come, let's talk.

00:12:37.954 --> 00:12:38.954
- Welcome. - Goodbye, sir.

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:40.024
- Goodbye, sir. - Please, go on in.

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:42.394
- Gosh, I'm so jealous. - So jealous.

00:12:42.454 --> 00:12:43.724
He must be off somewhere great.

00:12:51.534 --> 00:12:53.804
The director of the institute spoke very highly of you.

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:55.204
You're too kind, sir.

00:12:55.434 --> 00:13:00.174
Don't waste your time bowing to me. Save it for when it really counts,

00:13:00.274 --> 00:13:03.044
and bow to the powerless with all your heart.

00:13:03.144 --> 00:13:06.254
You're the senior judge my institute class admires the most.

00:13:06.314 --> 00:13:07.914
I know. I'm popular.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.994
Why hasn't this guy shown up yet?

00:13:21.664 --> 00:13:23.234
Hey, where are you going?

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:29.034
What do you believe makes a good judge?

00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:32.504
One who treats both sides fairly and listens closely to both sides...

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:35.074
Are there judges who don't do that? Give me something other than that.

00:13:36.114 --> 00:13:37.114
Well...

00:13:37.714 --> 00:13:39.184
- Also... - Being honest.

00:13:40.354 --> 00:13:43.654
Don't pretend you know everything. Honestly admit what you don't know.

00:13:44.184 --> 00:13:45.824
Do you have the courage to admit that in court?

00:13:52.124 --> 00:13:53.794
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:13:54.564 --> 00:13:57.264
I should've changed the password.

00:13:57.334 --> 00:13:58.364
What's with your getup?

00:13:58.464 --> 00:14:01.974
Why can just anyone waltz in when the owner's away?

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:03.204
Get us two coffees.

00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:08.974
What, does this look like a coffee shop?

00:14:09.744 --> 00:14:12.044
Coffee at a chicken joint? It's ridiculous.

00:14:12.614 --> 00:14:15.684
I can hear you. And only fill water three-fifths full.

00:14:18.784 --> 00:14:21.924
Anyway, to be a good judge,

00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:23.924
you first have to be a good person.

00:14:24.494 --> 00:14:28.094
- Yes, sir. I'll work hard. - You'd better.

00:14:32.334 --> 00:14:33.774
Here. Three-fifths.

00:14:37.674 --> 00:14:39.244
Or thirteen-twentieths.

00:14:40.374 --> 00:14:41.714
Thirteen-twentieths?

00:14:42.274 --> 00:14:43.844
- Master Shin. - What?

00:14:43.914 --> 00:14:45.284
Give me half a chicken.

00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:48.014
- Oh, come on. - I don't have time. Hurry up.

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:49.754
Half a chicken?

00:15:07.104 --> 00:15:09.204
That temper of his.

00:15:16.384 --> 00:15:18.014
- Go on, eat. - After you, sir.

00:15:18.114 --> 00:15:20.654
- No, you eat first. - Yes, sir.

00:15:25.354 --> 00:15:27.594
- So? How is it? - It's delicious. Please, have some.

00:15:28.324 --> 00:15:31.064
This place has great whole chicken. It wouldn't be a bad place to work.

00:15:31.124 --> 00:15:33.834
- I'll work hard for you either way. - No.

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.334
I'm saying you're going to work here.

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:44.044
Master Shin is a bit of a handful, but he knows his stuff.

00:15:44.544 --> 00:15:46.374
I have a trial this afternoon.

00:15:46.774 --> 00:15:47.774
But sir...

00:15:47.844 --> 00:15:50.644
No, that's all right. Don't get up. Enjoy your meal.

00:15:50.714 --> 00:15:53.384
And from today on, you'll be clocking out from here.

00:15:56.654 --> 00:15:59.324
- Have a word with me. - You're right we need to talk.

00:16:04.724 --> 00:16:07.134
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

00:16:07.494 --> 00:16:09.564
- Are you kidding me? - Am I?

00:16:10.464 --> 00:16:11.934
It's an official judicial assignment.

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:15.734
Right, so why move a judge's aide to a chicken shop?

00:16:16.074 --> 00:16:17.604
Where on earth is there a law that allows this?

00:16:17.674 --> 00:16:20.714
- There's no law that says I can't. - And there's no law saying you can!

00:16:22.344 --> 00:16:25.444
How can a man on the taxpayers' dime get away with something like this?

00:16:25.514 --> 00:16:29.654
You always duck out on the clock, running up tabs all over town,

00:16:29.724 --> 00:16:31.724
and messing up the economy for us common folk.

00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:36.894
Pulling strings for people now? Do your superiors know about this?

00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:38.464
(Chicken Center)

00:16:38.594 --> 00:16:42.464
If they knew, could you still waltz around in broad daylight?

00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:49.774
What, did I commit a crime? Why can't I walk around?

00:16:49.974 --> 00:16:53.114
The South Korean Judiciary is so very just.

00:16:53.414 --> 00:16:57.244
A judge using blackmail and threats? Our court system is something else.

00:16:57.844 --> 00:16:58.884
Master Shin.

00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:03.854
- Stop your whining and take this. - I don't want to.

00:17:03.924 --> 00:17:05.654
- Take it. - I said no!

00:17:08.324 --> 00:17:11.364
Gangchun's Salted Seafood Merchants have sued a TV network.

00:17:11.594 --> 00:17:14.294
Mediate between them and settle this before the trial starts.

00:17:14.364 --> 00:17:18.664
Why should they settle? It's cleaner to sort it in court.

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.774
Who ever said trials are clean?

00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:22.703
This trial will take at least a year.

00:17:22.704 --> 00:17:23.704
And the costs will be enormous.

00:17:23.774 --> 00:17:27.414
Plus, if they're tied up in court, they can't run their businesses.

00:17:27.474 --> 00:17:30.784
They may lose, and even if they win, what would they have really gained?

00:17:30.844 --> 00:17:31.884
But what about me?

00:17:32.214 --> 00:17:34.714
I'm also just trying to get by day by day.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.884
- It's tough enough paying my rent! - I'm paying for the part-timer.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.554
I'm even giving you an employee.

00:17:40.254 --> 00:17:41.854
A guy who's smarter than you, at that.

00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:44.664
He'll be a big help. Now take it.

00:17:44.724 --> 00:17:46.434
- What? - Good luck!

00:17:46.894 --> 00:17:50.404
Hey, who asked for an employee? You can't just leave!

00:17:50.864 --> 00:17:52.464
Take this punk with you!

00:17:54.304 --> 00:17:57.404
'The chicken here is great. It wouldn't be a bad place to work.'

00:17:58.304 --> 00:18:00.744
'I'm telling you to work here.'

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:40.884
Yes, this is a fried chicken restaurant.

00:18:41.714 --> 00:18:46.224
No, we don't deliver before six. Hold on a second.

00:18:47.194 --> 00:18:48.794
Okay, go ahead with the address.

00:18:49.554 --> 00:18:51.194
I'm from the Seoul Central District Court...

00:18:51.294 --> 00:18:52.964
I heard you, okay?

00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:55.093
So, before it gets cold,

00:18:55.094 --> 00:18:56.194
- Wait... - deliver it.

00:18:58.934 --> 00:19:02.404
Hey. three whole chickens, ten dollars. Get the cash.

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:06.174
I'm just really curious about something.

00:19:06.774 --> 00:19:09.644
What exactly is this place? Do you only sell fried chickens?

00:19:09.714 --> 00:19:11.914
Go on, hurry. Before they get soggy.

00:19:16.214 --> 00:19:18.224
(Chicken Center)

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:23.994
I was supposed to become a judge.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:26.094
But just like that...

00:19:26.794 --> 00:19:28.594
I became an employee at a fried chicken restaurant.

00:19:28.764 --> 00:19:30.963
(I was supposed to become a judge...)

00:19:30.964 --> 00:19:33.034
(but I became an employee at a fried chicken restaurant.)

00:19:42.344 --> 00:19:46.284
Alright, can you all see this? It's the Daily Chicken Man, Kkokkio.

00:19:46.354 --> 00:19:49.214
Guess what's coming up next? This is going to be epic.

00:19:50.924 --> 00:19:52.184
He's here!

00:19:57.564 --> 00:19:58.894
Oh my goodness.

00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:03.804
You're rocking that suit. Oh, hold on. Come on in.

00:20:03.964 --> 00:20:05.364
Right this way.

00:20:05.434 --> 00:20:09.404
Never mind your shoes. Come on in. Look right at the middle camera.

00:20:09.504 --> 00:20:13.274
We're going to say "Kkokkio." One, two, three.

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:17.644
- Kkokkio! - Kko...

00:20:18.044 --> 00:20:19.344
Well, goodbye.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.854
(Hujin Arcade)

00:20:33.364 --> 00:20:34.964
Where did Master Shin go?

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:38.664
Tell Master Shin I want to see him when he gets back.

00:20:40.704 --> 00:20:42.304
Who should I say is asking?

00:20:44.644 --> 00:20:45.644
(Pluto, Welcome)

00:20:46.644 --> 00:20:48.074
There he goes again. Honestly.

00:20:48.144 --> 00:20:49.144
A dry cleaner's?

00:20:52.344 --> 00:20:55.914
Have Master Shin see me when he's back.

00:20:55.984 --> 00:20:57.954
- Sir, could you tell me your na... - Don't touch me!

00:20:58.954 --> 00:21:00.224
What?

00:21:00.994 --> 00:21:03.264
(Pluto, Welcome)

00:21:04.994 --> 00:21:07.164
Alright, who's the jerk that knocked over my sign?

00:21:17.404 --> 00:21:19.574
- Oh, a Chinese restaurant? - Get out of my way.

00:21:20.814 --> 00:21:23.384
- I said, get out of my way! - Are you looking for the owner?

00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:26.014
He's not here right now. And the door's locked.

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:27.314
What part of that don't you understand?

00:21:27.654 --> 00:21:28.684
I said get out of my way!

00:21:31.554 --> 00:21:34.754
Hey, what do you think you're doing? You can't just assault a bystander.

00:21:35.724 --> 00:21:38.324
Then why were you standing there? I told you to get out of the way.

00:21:39.864 --> 00:21:41.434
Hey, why are you talking to me like that?

00:21:41.494 --> 00:21:42.764
The boss told me to let you in.

00:21:45.904 --> 00:21:46.933
Hi.

00:21:46.934 --> 00:21:48.774
She taught that boy a lesson.

00:21:52.404 --> 00:21:56.484
(Chicken Center)

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.154
So, the delivery?

00:22:07.194 --> 00:22:08.354
Here's the money for the chicken.

00:22:11.794 --> 00:22:16.234
The dry cleaner, the Chinese place, and a weird woman in a helmet came.

00:22:16.294 --> 00:22:17.664
Hey, tell me later.

00:22:18.634 --> 00:22:20.704
I'm in a hurry. I have to get back before the dinner rush.

00:22:20.774 --> 00:22:21.834
Am I coming with you?

00:22:22.534 --> 00:22:24.574
What's a parachute hire like you going to do here all alone?

00:22:24.974 --> 00:22:25.974
Excuse me?

00:22:26.714 --> 00:22:28.074
It's true. You're a parachute hire.

00:22:28.144 --> 00:22:30.684
A parachute hire? I'm a judge.

00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:33.484
Hey, did you have to pass an exam to work here?

00:22:33.554 --> 00:22:35.684
Well, no. Judge Kim Sang Geun told me to work here, so...

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:38.384
He pulled some strings for you. That's what a parachute hire is.

00:22:38.454 --> 00:22:41.594
Don't you ever mention that old geezer's name in front of me again.

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.194
Where are we going?

00:22:46.424 --> 00:22:47.434
To run an errand.

00:22:52.364 --> 00:22:56.404
You violated the Road Traffic Act by not obeying a traffic signal.

00:23:00.774 --> 00:23:02.914
Do you want to get the crap beaten out of you?

00:23:04.414 --> 00:23:06.853
On top of a 60-dollar fine and 15 points,

00:23:06.854 --> 00:23:08.254
you'd also violate Criminal Act 260...

00:23:08.414 --> 00:23:10.024
Get out, you punk. You're fired.

00:23:11.824 --> 00:23:13.294
Hurry up and get out.

00:23:51.694 --> 00:23:55.694
I'm a huge fan of On-site Pursuit.

I'm sorry to bother you, but could I please get your autograph?

Did you know they're suing you and the network for defamation?

00:24:14.484 --> 00:24:15.484
And?

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:19.224
Well, I mean, if you two sue each other,

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:24.494
it's a waste of time and money. It's best to reach an agreement...

00:24:24.564 --> 00:24:26.494
What kind of settlement are you talking about?

00:24:26.794 --> 00:24:29.794
- What did I even do? - No, that's what I'm saying.

00:24:29.934 --> 00:24:34.004
What could you have done wrong for them to sue you like this?

00:24:34.604 --> 00:24:36.644
Are you the lawyer for the Salted Seafood Cooperative?

00:24:36.744 --> 00:24:39.844
Oh, please. If I were a lawyer, do you think I'd be here?

00:24:39.904 --> 00:24:42.044
I'd be duking it out with them in court.

00:24:43.144 --> 00:24:46.984
Then in what capacity are you here? What is it that you do?

00:24:47.084 --> 00:24:48.984
- Oh, me? - Yes.

00:24:49.514 --> 00:24:54.494
Well, to put it one way, I'm an expert in these matters.

00:24:55.254 --> 00:25:00.134
His Honour sent me today, so you can just think of me as a mediator.

00:25:00.364 --> 00:25:01.534
His Honour sent you?

00:25:01.894 --> 00:25:03.964
Judge Kim Sang Geun...

00:25:04.234 --> 00:25:06.334
wants you to settle this amicably.

00:25:07.604 --> 00:25:10.244
Look, we don't have much time before the trial, so...

00:25:10.344 --> 00:25:12.974
when we meet next, I'll come with a more specific proposal...

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:14.214
That won't be necessary.

00:25:14.544 --> 00:25:17.314
- What? - From now on, talk to my lawyer.

00:25:17.844 --> 00:25:18.844
If you'll excuse me.

00:25:20.854 --> 00:25:22.484
Hey, wait, Producer Kim.

00:25:23.484 --> 00:25:24.484
Kim...

00:25:27.994 --> 00:25:28.994
Hey!

00:25:32.394 --> 00:25:36.034
What are you doing here? I told you, you're fired, you punk.

00:25:36.264 --> 00:25:39.334
You may be the boss, but strictly speaking, you're not my employer.

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:41.304
Therefore, you have no authority to fire me. Also...

00:25:41.404 --> 00:25:43.204
Then who is your employer?

00:25:45.274 --> 00:25:46.274
Also,

00:25:46.744 --> 00:25:49.674
I worked too hard to get certified to give up this easily.

00:25:49.914 --> 00:25:52.044
And if this is truly an order from Judge Kim Sang Geun,

00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:53.584
then I have to survive.

00:25:54.314 --> 00:25:55.514
I've made up my mind.

00:25:55.984 --> 00:25:57.354
Stop staring so intensely when you talk.

00:25:57.684 --> 00:25:59.184
How did you know to come here?

00:25:59.454 --> 00:26:00.454
Were you following me?

00:26:01.354 --> 00:26:03.394
I saw the documents at the shop. I just had a feeling you'd be here.

00:26:03.464 --> 00:26:04.464
Why you...

00:26:06.524 --> 00:26:07.664
Give me your license.

00:26:10.034 --> 00:26:11.034
Drive.

00:26:23.444 --> 00:26:24.844
(Gangchun Market: "Maggot Salted Seafood")

00:26:24.914 --> 00:26:27.284
You know the Maggot Salted Seafood Scandal?

00:26:27.354 --> 00:26:29.484
I never miss On-site Pursuit.

00:26:30.184 --> 00:26:33.023
Maggots were in the salted seafood cooperative for sale...

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:34.054
and in the co-op's own stock.

00:26:34.224 --> 00:26:37.924
The Food and Drug Safety Ministry investigated but found no issues.

00:26:38.164 --> 00:26:42.764
After the broadcast, sales plummeted and many shops closed, ruining them.

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:47.334
So the merchants are suing. But it's hard to beat a network.

00:26:47.534 --> 00:26:50.074
Korean law only allows compensation from the media, so...

00:26:50.144 --> 00:26:54.844
That's why we're going to mediate. To settle before it goes to trial.

00:26:55.044 --> 00:26:56.044
A settlement agreement?

00:26:56.644 --> 00:26:57.644
You are?

00:26:58.244 --> 00:27:00.154
- Why? - Why do you think?

00:27:00.454 --> 00:27:02.584
Because that darn old geezer...

00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:04.624
ordered me to.

00:27:04.684 --> 00:27:07.424
Oh, did you major in law? Or maybe you're a lawyer...

00:27:07.494 --> 00:27:11.494
Do I need a license to stop a fight? Stop with the law, article, clause!

00:27:12.394 --> 00:27:14.094
- Well, not necessarily... - Step on it.

00:27:14.164 --> 00:27:15.164
Yes, sir.

(We're closing down. we apologise. Kim Young Ho, apologise now!)

00:28:08.714 --> 00:28:11.054
- What is this place? - A public market.

00:28:11.484 --> 00:28:13.724
They closed down a month after the show aired.

00:28:13.794 --> 00:28:16.324
Goodness, where did the maggots on the show come from?

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:20.194
I'm not sure about that. We were strict about our sanitation.

00:28:20.594 --> 00:28:24.134
I heard Yun Ho's family sold up too. With business being so bad,

00:28:24.204 --> 00:28:27.534
When Mr. Park offers a good price, let's just sell quickly. Okay?

00:28:27.604 --> 00:28:31.574
Your mother raised you on this shop. And now, for a few extra bucks,

00:28:31.674 --> 00:28:34.844
- you'd sell your mother's spirit? - Spirit or not...

00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:38.344
- We're about to starve, Granny! - Be quiet.

00:28:38.414 --> 00:28:40.984
Stop fighting.

00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:44.084
Alright. Everyone.

00:28:44.724 --> 00:28:47.124
Come on, we all need to stick together.

00:28:47.924 --> 00:28:51.064
I mean, we have people who came from far away,

00:28:51.264 --> 00:28:53.124
so let's hear what these people have to say.

00:28:53.664 --> 00:28:58.364
That person is from City Hall, and they were sent by the judge.

00:28:58.804 --> 00:29:01.104
Why are they ordering business owners around?

00:29:01.304 --> 00:29:05.274
You all filed a lawsuit against the network and Kim Young Ho...

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:08.114
for defamation, is that correct?

00:29:08.474 --> 00:29:10.884
I'm the person sent by the judge.

00:29:11.014 --> 00:29:14.514
Usually, once a trial starts, it can take, well, over a year,

00:29:14.584 --> 00:29:18.024
and as you all know, the costs are very high.

00:29:18.184 --> 00:29:21.594
So, it's better for both sides to reach a settlement.

00:29:21.754 --> 00:29:23.594
That is the judge's opinion.

00:29:23.794 --> 00:29:26.764
If we win, won't the other side have to pay the court fees?

00:29:26.824 --> 00:29:31.704
That's true if you win the trial. But that's precisely the problem.

00:29:32.134 --> 00:29:34.134
Hey, explain it to them.

00:29:34.274 --> 00:29:38.604
I've reviewed the complaint, and the network is legally favoured.

00:29:38.874 --> 00:29:41.474
- Even if you appeal... - If you lose the trial,

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:44.884
I mean, who is going to cover those costs?

00:29:44.944 --> 00:29:47.614
Where would we get that kind of money?

00:29:47.684 --> 00:29:49.684
Okay. Everyone, calm down,

00:29:49.984 --> 00:29:53.054
Let's discuss what would be most helpful for the merchants here.

00:29:53.154 --> 00:29:57.924
The apology broadcast you all want realistically won't happen.

00:29:58.124 --> 00:30:01.833
So, the idea is to demand damages and wrap this up amicably...

00:30:01.834 --> 00:30:03.034
What are we, beggars?

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:07.634
Forget that. Tell Producer Kim to get on TV and beg forgiveness.

00:30:07.934 --> 00:30:08.934
Ma'am.

00:30:09.404 --> 00:30:11.874
This isn't something to approach so emotionally.

00:30:12.044 --> 00:30:14.614
You should get actual compensation for your damages.

00:30:15.244 --> 00:30:18.984
What are actual damages? Do you know what people are saying?

00:30:19.044 --> 00:30:20.654
They say Gangchun salted seafood...

00:30:20.954 --> 00:30:22.514
is something you wouldn't even feed to a dog.

00:30:22.914 --> 00:30:26.284
"It's garbage teeming with maggots. You eat it and drop dead."

00:30:26.554 --> 00:30:28.194
My whole life,

00:30:28.394 --> 00:30:31.994
I've treated my fermenting barrels as more pristine than my own body.

00:30:32.064 --> 00:30:33.394
Everyone sitting here has.

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:37.134
Ma'am, because of your stubbornness, everyone will suffer twice as much.

00:30:37.234 --> 00:30:40.474
Never mind twice, if I die 12 times, what's wrong is wrong.

00:30:40.534 --> 00:30:45.174
Either restore all the shops here, or have him admit his fault...

00:30:45.274 --> 00:30:47.913
and get on TV and grovel for forgiveness.

00:30:47.914 --> 00:30:52.814
If not, I'll salt his palms. Only then will I sign!

00:30:55.014 --> 00:30:56.914
Granny!

00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:05.093
Please understand. She's just very upset.

00:31:05.094 --> 00:31:08.694
Everyone's in a tough situation, so they'll settle for a fair price.

00:31:08.764 --> 00:31:12.304
I guess pulling out his tongue and pickling it in salt is faster.

00:31:13.164 --> 00:31:14.174
Let's go.

00:31:17.574 --> 00:31:18.974
She's certainly stubborn.

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:21.144
I can understand the merchants' position.

00:31:21.214 --> 00:31:24.784
Does "understanding" pay the rent? Does it put food on the table?

00:31:24.844 --> 00:31:25.914
I'll be right back.

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:29.684

00:31:30.624 --> 00:31:34.354

No, it's not that. I'm here for some salted seafood.

00:32:05.224 --> 00:32:07.424
My mother really likes it.

00:32:08.054 --> 00:32:09.054
Oh...

00:32:12.064 --> 00:32:14.994
What kind does she like?

00:32:16.164 --> 00:32:17.304
Oh, well, here.

00:32:17.664 --> 00:32:21.604
Here, have a taste of this. It's salted fermented squid.

00:32:21.674 --> 00:32:25.104
- Ours is the best around. - Oh, thank you.

00:32:26.504 --> 00:32:28.514
- Boss. - Yes?

00:32:30.074 --> 00:32:34.684
Did you go for fermented seafood or to get pickled yourself?

00:32:34.754 --> 00:32:37.884
There was a little misunderstanding, but I bought some.

00:32:38.724 --> 00:32:41.094
- This is the squid, right? - Yes, she threw that in for free.

00:32:41.654 --> 00:32:43.594
Hey, let's go shopping.

00:32:47.129 --> 00:32:50.039

Right, I'll call you.

Please, have a seat.

- Please get them some drinks. - Yes, sir.

00:33:16.229 --> 00:33:17.459
Thank you.

00:33:18.699 --> 00:33:21.929
I wonder if they'll have any decent listings.

00:33:22.369 --> 00:33:25.339
You're not a local. Are you looking to invest?

00:33:25.639 --> 00:33:27.209
Or looking to move?

00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:31.339
Investing, of course. Those beach shops look pretty good.

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:32.709
The view is so wide open.

00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:35.779
You're a step too late. There's nothing available there.

00:33:35.879 --> 00:33:37.179
But we saw plenty of empty store fronts.

00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:39.689
Those are all gone. Most were urgent sales, and...

00:33:39.749 --> 00:33:42.089
stores without key money get snapped up right away.

00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:45.189
Instead of that area, if you go ten minutes further from here...

No, no, no. I'm set on that location.

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:50.599

00:33:56.099 --> 00:33:57.769
Snap out of it, man.

Oh, the granny's seafood place?

00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:05.579
Yes, that's the one. I want that spot.

00:34:05.749 --> 00:34:10.049
Imagine a building of all glass. The ocean's right there.

00:34:10.119 --> 00:34:12.319
- It'd be a prime spot for the view. - Exactly.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.949
Ocean views by day, a sunset mecca by night.

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:16.459
It's got social media hot spot written all over it.

00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:20.059
Look, I'll pay whatever it costs. Just sell it to me.

00:34:20.129 --> 00:34:21.429
The old lady isn't selling her shop.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:22.499
What? Why not?

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:24.229
I do have something in the works with her.

Oh, so you are talking. Perfect.

00:34:26.729 --> 00:34:30.399

This whole business area is dead, but you're saying they're all sold?

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:43.549
- It's right on the waterfront. - What about the shop next door?

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:45.919
- That one's sold, too. - And the one next to that one?

00:34:46.019 --> 00:34:47.049
I'm sorry.

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:51.359
This is ridiculous. So ridiculous. A shame, but nothing can be done.

00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:53.389
- Let's go. - Yes, Boss.

00:34:53.459 --> 00:34:54.989
If you'd like to leave your number, I can...

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:57.699
That's all right. Thanks for your time.

00:34:57.759 --> 00:34:58.899
Okay. Take care.

00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:04.839
Who's buying shops in an area with no customers or business?

00:35:05.039 --> 00:35:08.469
This is strange, right? The whole key money situation...

00:35:08.569 --> 00:35:10.109
And his reaction to the premium.

00:35:17.619 --> 00:35:18.949
Did you get the pictures?

00:35:19.549 --> 00:35:23.319
- He seemed a little suspicious. - Hurry, before scumbags show up.

00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:25.419
You know what this deal is worth, right?

00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:31.329
Why use patches if you won't rest? How else will you get better?

00:35:31.429 --> 00:35:33.899
My Gi Beom is the only one who looks out for me.

00:35:34.529 --> 00:35:35.599
Come on, eat up.

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:40.709
Grandma, let's move out of here.

00:35:40.809 --> 00:35:43.179
Not this again. Where would we get the money?

00:35:43.239 --> 00:35:46.879
We can sell the shop, and I told you I'll handle the rest.

00:35:46.949 --> 00:35:50.049
Oh, stop with that nonsense and just eat.

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:52.279
Here, try some. It's fermented just right.

00:35:53.249 --> 00:35:56.689
I'm so sick of this seafood. So sick of it.

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:03.429
That little brat. Oh, Gi Beom!

00:36:03.729 --> 00:36:05.229
Don't you know how stubborn my grandma is?

00:36:06.329 --> 00:36:10.239
You said if I did what he asked, there wouldn't be any trouble.

00:36:10.269 --> 00:36:15.109
You never said it would be on TV. Now I've ruined all the local shops.

00:36:16.739 --> 00:36:19.179
Fine. I'll head there.

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:39.499
Hey, Pillip.

00:36:40.569 --> 00:36:42.398
What are you doing? Pick up.

00:36:42.399 --> 00:36:43.399
Sure.

00:36:45.569 --> 00:36:47.369
Yes, hello? This is the chicken shop.

00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:49.509
Yes.

00:36:49.709 --> 00:36:52.079
We’re a bit backed up right now, so it’ll take about an hour.

00:36:52.579 --> 00:36:53.809
Thanks.

00:36:54.609 --> 00:36:56.578
Sir, one spicy and two regulars for delivery.

00:36:56.579 --> 00:36:59.288
What’s going on today?

00:36:59.289 --> 00:37:01.849
Did every other chicken shop in the neighbourhood close down?

00:37:05.519 --> 00:37:06.629
Here you go.

00:37:09.059 --> 00:37:10.099
I got tricked.

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:12.829
Here.

00:37:13.129 --> 00:37:14.499
Here.

00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:18.569
Here.

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:27.249
Is he out delivering somewhere?

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:28.579
What?

00:37:29.279 --> 00:37:30.279
Who are you talking about?

00:37:30.419 --> 00:37:32.918
Look right here. That’s where our viewers are watching from.

00:37:32.919 --> 00:37:33.948
How about a quick greeting?

00:37:33.949 --> 00:37:35.959
On the count of three, just shout "Kokkio!"

00:37:35.989 --> 00:37:37.018
One, two, three.

00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:38.819
Kokkio!

00:37:47.029 --> 00:37:48.369
Yes, this is the chicken shop.

00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:53.509
We’re actually sold out for the day.

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:55.839
I'm sorry.

00:37:57.939 --> 00:37:59.949
Thanks, please call again next time.

00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:02.279
Sure.

00:38:09.719 --> 00:38:11.759
Where is Mr. Shin, anyway?

00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:17.159
What is he really doing?

00:38:22.529 --> 00:38:25.799
When did Player Kim get in here?

00:38:25.939 --> 00:38:27.468
Player Kim could hack...

00:38:27.469 --> 00:38:29.538
The Blue House with one computer.

00:38:29.539 --> 00:38:30.539
Wow, how many computers...

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.009
do they even have in here?

00:38:35.149 --> 00:38:37.449
Oh, they're not all mine.

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:39.819
I'm working for free.

00:38:39.919 --> 00:38:43.188
Hey, and besides, I've been out of the game a while.

00:38:43.189 --> 00:38:46.459
You literally wash your hands every day.

00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:49.899
Though you've been away,

00:38:50.499 --> 00:38:53.629
You're still sharp?

00:38:58.339 --> 00:39:01.709
You want me to pull real estate records?

00:39:01.969 --> 00:39:03.039
Yes.

00:39:03.179 --> 00:39:05.509
It's a small agency in the country,

00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:07.779
they're buying commercial property without paying key money,

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:12.379
They sometimes add a premium instead of key money.

00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:14.489
Where's that premium from?

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.059
I want to know about that.

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:18.089
Darn...

00:39:18.259 --> 00:39:20.328
It's illegal.

00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:21.729
Of course it's illegal.

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:24.198
But 15 years ago, I legally got you,

00:39:24.199 --> 00:39:27.069
out of the slammer.

00:39:28.569 --> 00:39:30.898
Is this Gomtang or Seolleongtang?

00:39:30.899 --> 00:39:32.938
How often did you reboil this?

00:39:32.939 --> 00:39:35.908
I still don't know how to repay you.

00:39:35.909 --> 00:39:39.139
Just repay the favour and forget about it.

00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:42.079
This must be why people come...

00:39:42.549 --> 00:39:46.149
to internet cafes just to eat.

00:39:46.649 --> 00:39:49.219
Sexy food.

00:39:53.389 --> 00:39:54.928
Can you look into someone for me?

00:39:54.929 --> 00:39:56.828
(Chicken Center)

00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:58.399
No, it’s not what you're thinking.

00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:01.769
I just want to know how he is

00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:04.999
His background, that sort of thing.

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:06.809
Yes, anything.

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:14.449
Be careful.

00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:19.549
- How old are you? - Twenty-three.

00:40:20.149 --> 00:40:22.219
You're 9 years younger and so rude.

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:23.689
What a fossil.

00:40:24.019 --> 00:40:25.819
You're one to talk, always snooping.

00:40:29.129 --> 00:40:30.799
- Did you hear that? - What if I did?

00:40:32.629 --> 00:40:33.669
Wait.

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:35.499
It's not what you think.

00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:36.999
And what is it you think I'm thinking?

00:40:45.279 --> 00:40:47.709
Technically, kicking me earlier was assault.

00:40:47.879 --> 00:40:49.418
Criminal Act, Article 260,

00:40:49.419 --> 00:40:51.619
simple assault...

00:40:51.679 --> 00:40:53.089
carries a fine up to 5,000 dollars or...

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:54.419
Get lost!

00:41:00.159 --> 00:41:02.559
It's not that I'm going to sue you for real.

00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:03.899
Go on, sue me.

00:41:07.669 --> 00:41:10.869
Don't kick a man when he's down.

00:41:11.999 --> 00:41:13.669
That's just cruel!

00:41:22.649 --> 00:41:24.079
I'm home.

00:41:24.479 --> 00:41:26.089
Hey, is that our Judge Cho?

00:41:26.419 --> 00:41:28.018
You're late. Have you eaten?

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:29.319
I'm not hungry.

00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:32.219
I bought some some salted fermented seafood for you.

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:34.389
Oh, you shouldn't have.

00:41:35.529 --> 00:41:38.799
This is from Gangchun...

00:41:38.859 --> 00:41:41.668
It's not what you think. It was carefully prepared by the owner.

00:41:41.669 --> 00:41:43.038
I saw it for myself.

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:45.869
Well, if our honourable judge says so, I guess it’s fine.

00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:48.509
How was your first day?

00:41:49.509 --> 00:41:51.539
Looks like you had a team dinner? Chicken and beer?

00:41:54.779 --> 00:41:56.548
- Yes. - You must be tired.

00:41:56.549 --> 00:41:57.878
Go wash up and get some rest.

00:41:57.879 --> 00:42:00.788
Hey, sit down for a minute.

00:42:00.789 --> 00:42:01.789
Oh, come on...

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.418
Please don’t call me that. It’s embarrassing.

00:42:03.419 --> 00:42:05.989
Who did you take after to be so humble?

00:42:08.429 --> 00:42:10.458
Top of your class at the police academy.

00:42:10.459 --> 00:42:11.798
Passed the bar at the youngest age.

00:42:11.799 --> 00:42:14.269
First among your class to be appointed as a judge, right?

00:42:14.769 --> 00:42:17.568
In our whole family,

00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:19.068
you’re the first judge.

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.338
Your dad even changed your name

00:42:20.339 --> 00:42:22.169
in his phone to “Judge Cho.”

00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:24.878
Why don’t we just change the nameplate on our front gate too?

00:42:24.879 --> 00:42:26.708
- Should we? - Dad...

00:42:26.709 --> 00:42:27.809
All right.

00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:29.718
So how’s the work at court?

00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:30.819
What’d you do today?

00:42:31.319 --> 00:42:32.479
Well...

00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:38.019
I delivered fried chicken.

00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:40.559
"Hello, this is the chicken shop.” I took orders...

00:42:41.989 --> 00:42:43.099
and packed boxes.

00:42:44.299 --> 00:42:45.299
Just...

00:42:47.769 --> 00:42:48.899
worked.

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:50.698
If anyone’s giving you a hard time...

00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:52.969
Here, eat this instead.

00:42:53.009 --> 00:42:55.339
Even if he told you what he did at court, would you understand?

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:59.109
- Go on, get some rest. - Sure. Good night.

00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:05.418
The hairdresser gave me...

00:43:05.419 --> 00:43:07.018
way too much volume.

00:43:07.019 --> 00:43:09.019
- Why? I think it looks cute. - I look like an alien.

00:43:10.289 --> 00:43:12.488
(Award Certificate)

00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:14.329
(Award Certificate)

00:43:16.699 --> 00:43:18.329
In the end,

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.569
I still couldn’t tell my parents.

00:43:22.429 --> 00:43:23.998
That I am a judge who works...

00:43:23.999 --> 00:43:25.168
(Chicken Judge)

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:27.069
at a fried chicken shop.

00:43:31.079 --> 00:43:32.879
We will continue to dig deep...

00:43:33.179 --> 00:43:35.408
and uncover the hidden truths...

00:43:35.409 --> 00:43:37.379
buried in our society.

00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:40.649
When small voices come together,

00:43:41.049 --> 00:43:42.919
they can change the world.

00:43:43.419 --> 00:43:45.788
Your tips and concerns...

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.229
are the beginning of that change.

00:43:47.729 --> 00:43:49.829
We won’t stop...

00:43:50.529 --> 00:43:53.299
until the truth is no longer hidden.

00:43:58.199 --> 00:44:01.538
(On-site Pursuit)

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:02.569
Cut!

00:44:02.909 --> 00:44:03.909
Great job, everyone.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.249
- Good job, everyone. - Nice job.

00:44:06.649 --> 00:44:08.549
- Good job. - Good work.

00:44:10.679 --> 00:44:12.649
Sir, someone’s here to see you.

00:44:12.779 --> 00:44:14.489
Someone? Who?

00:44:18.219 --> 00:44:21.489
Did the shoot go well?

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:22.828
Hey, show some respect.

00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:25.399
This is Producer Kim.

00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:31.469
While I was reviewing the settlement papers,

00:44:31.539 --> 00:44:33.268
something came up that I wanted to ask.

00:44:33.269 --> 00:44:34.609
I told you I’m not settling.

00:44:34.769 --> 00:44:36.939
I hear you.

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:40.508
How did that container of maggot-filled salted seafood...

00:44:40.509 --> 00:44:41.779
even get discovered?

00:44:42.409 --> 00:44:43.879
I saw there were...

00:44:44.219 --> 00:44:45.978
more than just one or two containers.

00:44:45.979 --> 00:44:47.349
We got a tip-off

00:44:47.419 --> 00:44:49.489
Oh, I see.

00:44:49.519 --> 00:44:52.559
Seems like you think only the merchants are the victims here.

00:44:52.919 --> 00:44:54.428
But the whistleblower who came forward...

00:44:54.429 --> 00:44:56.759
they’re a victim too. Emotionally and psychologically.

00:44:58.259 --> 00:45:00.699
I guess that’s true.

00:45:01.129 --> 00:45:02.399
Producer Kim.

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.738
I actually wanted to ask that whistleblower something.

00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:06.138
Could you maybe share their contact info?

00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:07.569
I can't reveal the source. It’s confidential.

00:45:08.269 --> 00:45:09.509
Sorry,

00:45:09.609 --> 00:45:11.278
but under Korean civil and criminal procedure law,

00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:13.579
there’s no legal protection for journalists to withhold sources.

00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:17.049
Hey, what article and clause is that?

00:45:17.279 --> 00:45:18.548
- Well... - Hold on a second

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:20.249
So if that info gets brought up...

00:45:20.519 --> 00:45:23.419
in court anyway, then...

00:45:23.989 --> 00:45:25.619
Wouldn’t it be better...

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:27.188
for all of us to just…

00:45:27.189 --> 00:45:30.099
settle this peacefully instead?

00:45:30.799 --> 00:45:31.959
Producer Kim.

00:45:32.559 --> 00:45:35.369
How about the network issues...

00:45:35.969 --> 00:45:38.869
a quick apology broadcast?

00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:41.109
Are you trying...

00:45:42.569 --> 00:45:43.909
to threaten me right now?

00:45:44.039 --> 00:45:47.379
That’s a strong word. Not a threat.

00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:50.179
I meant, a negotiation.

00:45:54.649 --> 00:45:56.319
Sorry

00:45:58.389 --> 00:45:59.589
Hello, sir.

00:46:00.129 --> 00:46:01.189
What?

00:46:04.847 --> 00:46:06.176
What happened?

00:46:06.177 --> 00:46:07.946
Everyone else agreed to settle,

00:46:07.947 --> 00:46:09.617
so I went to convince the old lady at her shop.

00:46:09.747 --> 00:46:10.917
But it was closed.

00:46:10.987 --> 00:46:13.116
We went to her house because we were worried something happened.

00:46:13.117 --> 00:46:15.116
She was collapsed in her room, with a pill bottle beside her.

00:46:15.117 --> 00:46:16.157
How is she doing?

00:46:16.227 --> 00:46:18.457
We pumped her stomach and moved her to a room right away.

00:46:18.557 --> 00:46:20.856
Thankfully, we found her in time, and she's stable now.

00:46:20.857 --> 00:46:23.197
The moment she woke up, she asked for you two.

00:46:24.327 --> 00:46:28.697
(Gang Chun Hospital)

00:46:34.707 --> 00:46:36.047
Why would you do that?

00:46:37.307 --> 00:46:39.517
You haven’t even finished...

00:46:40.747 --> 00:46:42.817
salting that jerk yet.

00:47:01.337 --> 00:47:02.837
You know this already.

00:47:11.477 --> 00:47:13.217
to the way they were.

00:47:20.017 --> 00:47:21.087
Let’s just...

00:47:24.127 --> 00:47:25.427
sign the settlement.

00:47:54.217 --> 00:47:56.187
Why did she suddenly give up?

00:47:57.527 --> 00:47:58.887
Because of this old lady...

00:47:59.527 --> 00:48:00.897
nothing ever works out

00:48:02.127 --> 00:48:04.266
You wait by the car.

00:48:04.267 --> 00:48:05.296
What about you?

00:48:05.297 --> 00:48:07.397
I left something in the hospital room.

00:48:10.407 --> 00:48:11.537
Hello, sir?

00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:13.607
Where’s the patient from Room 203?

00:48:13.877 --> 00:48:15.077
Hold on.

00:48:20.417 --> 00:48:21.477
Hello, sir.

00:48:21.917 --> 00:48:23.047
It’s the hospital.

00:48:23.747 --> 00:48:25.686
After that big scene yesterday,

00:48:25.687 --> 00:48:26.817
the old lady took pills.

00:48:27.287 --> 00:48:29.487
If she ends up actually dying over this...

00:48:31.027 --> 00:48:32.157
Darn...

00:48:33.497 --> 00:48:36.367
If it comes to that, I’ll bring her seal myself.

00:48:50.047 --> 00:48:51.306
Hey, go inside and check.

00:48:51.307 --> 00:48:52.347
Yes, sir.

00:48:55.077 --> 00:48:56.547
Wait...

00:48:58.447 --> 00:48:59.457
What?

00:48:59.887 --> 00:49:01.587

I'm in the middle of frying chicken.

00:49:15.037 --> 00:49:16.266
Just get to the point.

You said it was just a corner store.

00:49:18.937 --> 00:49:22.077
I'm being traced right now.

00:49:22.277 --> 00:49:25.346

You should've told me earlier if you didn't like it.

00:57:44.407 --> 00:57:45.546
Which specific clauses?

00:57:45.547 --> 00:57:46.776
What wording do you want to change?

00:57:46.777 --> 00:57:49.177
All of it. Give the merchants what they want.

00:57:49.277 --> 00:57:52.586
We'll get the apology broadcast, as the original complaint requested.

00:57:52.587 --> 00:57:55.587
Do you think Director Kim and the station will ever agree?

00:57:55.787 --> 00:57:58.326
A settlement needs mutual consent.

00:57:58.327 --> 00:58:00.026
That's the law. From what I can see, this is...

00:58:00.027 --> 00:58:01.727
Who does that help?

00:58:01.857 --> 00:58:03.597
Are you on our side, or the law's?

00:58:16.807 --> 00:58:17.947
What is this?

00:58:22.077 --> 00:58:23.617
I'm going to do things my way.

00:58:23.847 --> 00:58:25.217
If it's wrong, I'll shut it down.

00:58:25.417 --> 00:58:27.616
But the livelihoods of the merchants are at stake here!

00:58:27.617 --> 00:58:30.787
For someone who got this job through connections, you sure talk a lot.

00:58:30.927 --> 00:58:33.597
I'm the boss, Master Shin.

00:58:36.027 --> 00:58:37.027
What?

00:58:43.507 --> 00:58:45.366
Hey, what's wrong with that truck?

00:58:45.367 --> 00:58:46.467
It's getting way too close.

00:58:48.307 --> 00:58:49.307
What?

00:59:05.527 --> 00:59:06.527
Hey, get out!

00:59:09.127 --> 00:59:11.027
The door won't open!

00:59:14.567 --> 00:59:16.437
Sir, the train...

00:59:17.207 --> 00:59:18.837
- What? - The train...

00:59:21.637 --> 00:59:22.637
Hey.

00:59:23.607 --> 00:59:26.047
Break the window and get out now!

00:59:39.227 --> 00:59:40.257
Please...

00:59:46.127 --> 00:59:48.097
The car behind us moved!

01:00:03.987 --> 01:00:05.887
Seriously, I’m swamped right now…

01:00:07.057 --> 01:00:08.087
What is it now?

01:00:08.217 --> 01:00:11.557
I told you, no deliveries before 6pm.

01:00:11.887 --> 01:00:12.957
Darn it.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.397
You need to hurry!

01:00:18.667 --> 01:00:19.697
Hurry!

01:00:25.937 --> 01:00:27.007
Mr. Shin!

01:01:15.917 --> 01:01:17.787
Why is it that every bad guy...

01:01:18.357 --> 01:01:19.827
pulls the same tricks?

01:01:31.207 --> 01:01:32.267
I guess...

01:01:32.867 --> 01:01:34.877
you haven’t heard.

01:01:35.937 --> 01:01:38.977
I am Mr. Shin!

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:40.917
Mr. Shin!

01:02:17.647 --> 01:02:20.617
(Shin's Project)

01:02:20.857 --> 01:02:24.156
Anyone who plays with lives, I never let them off the hook.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.256
What’s the plan?

01:02:25.257 --> 01:02:26.387
Get ready!

01:02:28.297 --> 01:02:30.726
Kkokkio!

01:02:30.727 --> 01:02:32.266
They breaks the law every chance they get,

01:02:32.267 --> 01:02:34.197
but they show no sign of guilt...

01:02:34.337 --> 01:02:37.037
I’d like a background check on this guy.

01:02:38.807 --> 01:02:40.436
There must be a reason he’s doing all this.

01:02:40.437 --> 01:02:42.107
We’re in a hurry. Move!

01:02:42.407 --> 01:02:45.247
We’re going to make them pay triple the pain.

01:02:47.077 --> 01:02:48.577
From now on, you’re negotiating with me.
