00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.340
Junxi.

[Episode 10: Love is a Secret
You Can't Hide]

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.840
This atmosphere...

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630
What am I supposed to do later?

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.730
[Secret Lover]

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.360
If you dare make fun of Tuo
for not having a mom again,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.790
I'll kick your butts!

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.550
Let's see if you dare do it again!

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.180
Tuo!

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.990
Tuo!

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.140
Tuo!

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.710
Finally found you.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.610
I chased them all away.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.490
From now on, just play with me.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.130
Ignore them.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.100
Maybe from that moment on,

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.390
I wanted to stay by his side...

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.770
to protect him.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.430
Running away isn't protecting.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.030
One lie leads to a hundred more.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.270
And it hurts the one I want to cherish,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.960
making him anxious and me uneasy.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.700
Are you really in such a hurry?

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.200
What am I supposed to do later?

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.360
Junxi.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.490
Dad, Mom...

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:30.940
We...

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.260
We've known for a long time.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.790
Finally, you decided to tell us.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.860
But I haven't said anything yet.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.440
He hasn't?

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.990
Honey, didn't you hear him?

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.860
I was just following your lead.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.230
Didn't we agree that

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.079
when Junxi came clean

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.380
about dating Tuo,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.470
I was supposed to follow your lead?

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.940
Follow you.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.880
So you've known all along?

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.690
And you also know

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.330
that Tuo and I are living together

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.200
not to save on rent,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.830
but because we're dating?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.740
Of course.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.110
I know

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.720
you're both very mature for your age.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.040
And you never give us any reason to worry.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.090
Why are you crying?

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.650
You must have been worried
we'd disapprove,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.200
and it's been weighing on you
for a long time, right?

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.420
I'm sorry.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.690
I've been lying to you all this time.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.670
I didn't know how to tell you

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.490
about my relationship with Tuo.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.220
I was afraid it would upset you

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.650
and that you'd

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.700
be disappointed in us.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.620
It's not his fault.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.770
I asked Junxi to lie

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.040
to hide the fact that we're dating.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.910
You didn't lie.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.590
You just didn't tell us.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.750
That's different from lying.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.900
Besides,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.700
you two didn't need to tell us.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.860
We already knew.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.020
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.409
Even without saying anything,

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.280
when you two are together,

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.460
it's obvious

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.610
that you only have eyes for each other.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.460
Real feelings can't be hidden.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.270
So all this time,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.490
I was the only one in the family

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.490
who didn't know you two were dating?

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.100
To think I've been worried for nothing!

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.830
Mom, look.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.080
I'm getting a bald spot!

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.270
Serves you right
for running away from home!

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.200
You deserve it!

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.970
Serves you right!

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.090
Alright, alright, alright.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.090
It's best if you go completely bald!

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.320
Go bald.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.060
You deserve it.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.900
You're serious about my brother,
aren't you?

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.040
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.700
I can put on a sour face too.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.450
Let's do it together then.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.690
From the moment I realized I liked him,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.830
all I wanted

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:43.370
was to be with him forever.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.650
So you want to marry him?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.820
Wherever he is,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.170
that's my home.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.610
This place too?

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.870
Then why are you making that face at me
when I'm your family?

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.380
And you've been giving me that sour face
since you were little.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.180
Because when we were little,
Junxi liked you more.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.730
Of course.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.140
He's my little brother.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.440
Jealous much?

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.820
Does Junxi know about that?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.830
Whatever happens,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.950
I've got your back.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.770
Kiddo!

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.720
Stay home for dinner tonight.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.540
By the way,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.700
when did you and Dad

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.900
find out that Tuo and I were together?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.500
Around your freshman spring semester.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.670
Right, honey?

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.770
I think so.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.050
It was around the time when you dragged me
to join some parenting class,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.480
saying it'd help us
understand our children better.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.480
But...

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.370
Tuo and I didn't get together
until sophomore year.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.690
So we've been wrong all this time.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.230
Well, son,

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.980
that means
you already liked each other very much

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.810
before you started dating.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.590
Otherwise,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.460
how could we have misunderstood?

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.910
Auntie said that?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.490
I only realized
after my mom pointed it out

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.620
that I'd already liked you so much
even back then.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.850
Why is it so messy here?

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.870
Let's tidy up together.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.030
How about we do it tomorrow?

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.630
I've missed you so much.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.650
You just said you liked me.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.220
Where is it?

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.010
How did it disappear?

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.410
What are you looking for?

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.230
Did I wake you?

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.890
Time to wake up anyway.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.430
I have class this morning.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.080
What are you looking for?

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.450
The ring you gave me.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.470
I clearly put it here.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.810
I put it away.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.600
Ever since we moved here,

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.270
you haven't been wearing it.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.420
I thought you didn't really like it.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.530
That was one of the reasons
that made you feel insecure, right?

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.710
Put it on me.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.170
You don't have to force yourself
for my sake.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.050
I didn't wear it
because I was afraid of losing it.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.940
And also because
if we wore matching rings,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.800
it'd attract too much attention.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.020
And if one day

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.550
you realized
we weren't right for each other

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.810
and wanted to break up,

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.570
it'd just be awkward.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.340
We'll never break up.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.090
Last time...

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.890
Let me finish.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.780
I thought that way at first.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.320
But when you said
we should break up last time,

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.500
I realized

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.560
that I could never break up with you.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.480
I've loved you so much for so long
that I can't imagine life without you.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.920
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.720
And I'll never bring it up again.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.980
You still have class this morning.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.410
I'll skip it.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.870
Didn't we go at it enough last night?

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.890
Not enough.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.560
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.210
If I win,

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.510
you'll go to school.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.120
Scissors,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.080
rock,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.750
paper.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.760
What are you doing?

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.750
After we get married,

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.780
I'll replace it with a wedding ring—

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.850
and only then can you take it off.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.930
And

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.760
no more leaving the ring at home.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.750
Let go.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.230
No.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.180
Let go.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.440
No.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.120
How can I hug you
if you don't let go of my hand?

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.500
We'll save up together

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.450
to buy our wedding rings, deal?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.200
Go.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.970
Go where?

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.220
Go to school.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.820
Or go to bed?

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.880
I thought you'd become a workaholic.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.530
Turns out you were just fighting with Tuo
and using work as a distraction.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.390
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you to worry.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.850
At least it turned out well.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.000
Uncle and Auntie are so supportive of you.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.460
That's really wonderful.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.970
Tuo and I promised them

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.420
we would work hard to become better people

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.880
and not make them worry.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.530
And having so many people
support you both,

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.990
that must feel wonderful.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.550
Xiaoyang!

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.850
Is that my lunch?

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.870
I brought you two packs of spicy radish.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.600
You really do know me best.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.510
Han Tuo?

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.570
Hold this for me.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.020
Let me borrow it.

Thank you.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.020
The professor asked me to tell you

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.620
that he hopes you'll return to school

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.750
as a guest lecturer.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:34.780
I knew it.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.230
When he asked me to return to school
for a second lecture,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.830
I knew he was up to something.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.340
Are you really

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.430
going to reject me?

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.250
Han Tuo!

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.330
Let's have a relationship
that feels light and easy.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.880
You like me?

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.720
I do.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:06.810
Why?

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.230
At first, I just thought
you were talented.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.310
I don't know when it started,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.700
but it hurts me inside to see you sad.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.840
You don't need to answer right away.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.300
I'll wait for your answer.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.890
I only like Junxi.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.110
Then I'll just have to wait
until you two fight again

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.460
and swoop in.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.210
I still won't choose you.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.050
You deserve someone
who genuinely likes you.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.240
What should I do?

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.130

Why such a huge change all of a sudden?

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.840
Did he get so much of Han Tuo's saliva
from kissing

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.650
that he turned into a jealousy monster?

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.380
Then why haven't you become
more and more like me?

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.970
What did you say?

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:56.900
Nothing.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.390
Xiaoyang, are you blushing right now?

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.650

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.060
and you just moved out—

to cover your living expenses.

Why are you so stubborn?

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.590
You suddenly came to see me

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.850
just to ask about this?

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.270
Where are you going?

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.500
Is arguing all that's left

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.490
between us as father and son?

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.620
When I was young,

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.780
all I did was work.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.290
When you were little, you cried a lot.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.170
I really didn't know what to do.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.330
So I just let your mom
take care of everything.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.530
She already had postpartum depression.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.570
But I still kept working.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.050
That also worsened

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.550
her mental health problems later.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.100
In the end, we divorced.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.730
I know I was wrong.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.560
But I still chose to keep running away.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.800
I always thought

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.230
that providing you with
good material conditions

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.890
would make up for everything.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.520
But I was wrong again.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.720
