Lian Xinruo!

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.518
I'll kill you!

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:12.519
Xinruo!

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.719

Jiang Yao!

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.520
Now we're even.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.800

Jiang Yao! Jiang Yao!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.680
Even after he lost his mind,
Jiang Yao still couldn't forget you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.320
Lian Xinruo,
you truly have a hold on him.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.920
But it's a pity.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.239
You and Pei Yuze will never be together.

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.439

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.400
Surrender now.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.360
No one in this world
has the right to judge me!

(Tablet of Beloved Father, Pei Yujie)

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.319
Feeling better?

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.319
I just didn't expect

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.919
that in the end,
Jiang Yao would be the one to save us.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.639
Yuze,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.640
the formula was burned.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.159
Don't lose hope.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.078
Today, Wen Yuan found a small vial

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.719
in Pei Xueshan's room.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.200
We still have a chance.

Second Master, Second Master!

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.278
The traveling doctor says several ingredients
match the ones in his pills.

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.039
This must be the antidote.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.879
I knew it!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.399
On my way out this morning,
I heard magpies chirping.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.919
I just knew good news was coming!

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.318
See? Here it is.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.558
To be honest,

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:23.719
I was worried sick earlier.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.919
My heart was racing.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.919
Don't worry. Things are looking up now.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.798
Xinruo.

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:28.759
Come.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.159
Think you can handle this?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.919
Why not?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.239
It looks fine to me.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.960
Isn't this how it's roasted?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.080
Trust me.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200
Are you sure?

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.799
It's catching fire!

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.480
All done!

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:08.999
Taste it.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.080
Just trust me this once.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.560
It doesn't look great,
but it tastes good.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:31.839
You tricked me again!

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.560
Red dragon.

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:43.200
Six bamboos.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.118
Alright.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:54.679
A little longer won't hurt.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.639
Can you really do this?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.920
Don't move. You have to trust me.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:06.999
Something feels off.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.038
No, it's not finished yet.

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.439
Just wait a little longer.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.160
See?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.640
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:28.839
Fine then.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.919
I'll draw one for you too.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.120
No thanks, I'm good.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.520
Don't cheat. Come back here!

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.899

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.840
Tired?

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.080
Not at all.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.840
Look at Pigsy carrying his bride.

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:54.879
You're the Pigsy.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.960
Yuze.

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.199
The power's out.

00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:11.439
Yuze?

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.640
Yuze? Yuze!

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:53.879
A red thread ties our fates together.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:58.599
A perfect match.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.080
May we grow old together with love
as fragrant as cassia and orchids.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.759
A bond sealed for life, a union blessed.

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:46.119
Like blossoms in spring,
may our home be filled with harmony.

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:59.799
With this vow of lifelong devotion,
I write it upon this red paper.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.039
Great.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.640
Let our vow of marriage...

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.080
be written in the registry.

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:30.239
Xinruo.

00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:44.039
Will you marry me?

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.960
I will.

00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:08.679
I want to wait
until our wedding to put it on.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.320
Alright.

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:18.199
On our wedding day,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.360
I will put it on you.

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:27.319
Well,

00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:30.959
I planned this surprise for so long.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.200
Shouldn't there be a little reward?

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:43.799
Not enough.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.120

The next couple is about to come in.

I'm sorry.

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:39.559
He was held up by something last minute.

Please give us a little more time.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.239
Honestly, how can he be late
for something this important?

You finally made it.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.238

I'm sorry.

We took the antidote.

There was only one antidote pill, right?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.280
Why did you lie to me?

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.439
What about the suppressant?

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.240
Where is the medicine now?

00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:04.718
We should take it right now,

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:05.879
then think of another way.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.359
It won't help.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.040
Why did you lie to me?

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.119

you would stay with me forever.
