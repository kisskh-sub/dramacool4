00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.180
(Episode 66)

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.710
What are you looking at?

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.520
Why did you open that?
You have no business looking in there.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.450
It's nothing.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.550
I was looking for your medicine,
and I just wondered what this was.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.320
Why are you awake?

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.160
That herbal medicine
should make you sleep well.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.960
I had a headache earlier,
so I took some medicine.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.230
You can't mix herbal and medicine.
It can be dangerous.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.340
Where is your medicine bottle?
I couldn't find it anywhere.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.910
I always keep it right here.
Did you forget?

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.310
I guess it slipped my mind.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.310
Have another dose and get some sleep.
I'll sleep with Se Ri tonight.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.680
I'll go warm it up for you.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.560
Does she even know
what she was looking at?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.100
What is it?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.340
We had him pose as a local petty thief
and arrested him on the spot.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.240
He's been turned over to the prosecutors.
And did you get the documents all right?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.910
I did. But everything else is still here.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.820
Won't he be suspicious
if this is the only thing gone?

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.990
It's just a suspicion. What can he do?
He's already been indicted.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.690
The case is closed.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.490
All right. Got it.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.230
Thank you for going to this trouble.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530
What a bolt from the blue.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.170
No, wait. Since we got it back,
it's not a clear day.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.410
It's a thunderbolt on a cloudy day.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.480
How did you find it so quickly?

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.010
Well, I was searching the area
and decided to check with the police.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.710
It turned out it was already there.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.490
That thief has the worst luck.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.250
That's as ridiculous as a mayfly's exam.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.790
What are you, the thief's sister?

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.830
Actually, he wasn't caught.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.530
He turned himself in.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.260
He dared to mess with Oh Pan Sool.
He must have been shaking in his boots.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.370
Wait a minute.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.870
But...

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.770
That's strange. Something's missing.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.010
What? What's missing?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.240
Well, um, everything else is here,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.550
but the contract for Han Kyung Soo
of Doeun Industries is missing.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880
What?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
That's weird.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.950
Look again carefully.
How could just that one file be gone?

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.320
That's what I'm saying.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.660
No, that's the only one missing. See?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.960
Are you sure you brought it back
exactly as it was?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.100
Yes, of course.
I brought it as the police gave it to me.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.500
Then did it grow legs and walk away?
Why is it gone?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.570
That was the most important one.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.440
Why are you taking it out on him?
He personally went to help you.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.580
This is driving me crazy.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.450
Doeun Industries...
Theirs is the only one gone!

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.820
How could this have happened?

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.620
Doeun Industries... Han Kyung Soo.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.530
Stealing only my father's contract.
That means they know what it is.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.100
This is too strange to be a coincidence.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.440
Then, could this also be...

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.740
Min Doo Sik's doing?

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.490
A document was delivered
for Chairman Min last night.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.990
What kind of document?

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.160
Chairman Min woke up unexpectedly,
so I couldn't get a look at it.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.530
I'll look for it.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.230
That's weird. I'm sure it was right here.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.770
It's gone?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.570
Min Doo Sik
must have moved it somewhere else.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.440
Then that must mean
it's an important document.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.180
What on earth could it be?

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.710
Good question.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.080
For him to be that concerned about it,
it can't be just any ordinary document.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.620
I'll call you later.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.390
Who is it?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.660
It's strange that my father's contract
was the only one that disappeared.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.100
Yes, it is strange.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.970
I'd even set up a meeting with Tae Joo.
And of all the times for this to happen...

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.570
Do you think Min Doo Sik is behind this?

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.310
As a matter of fact,
I just heard from Lucia.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.480
She said a document was sent to his house
by courier last night.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.380
I suspected as much.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.450
That devious man.
How could he go to such lengths?

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.060
To take the only piece of evidence
from the last remaining witness.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.160
Lucia said it's not at his house,
so I think it's in the chairman's office.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.100
The chairman's office?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.800
(Mingang Distribution)

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.600
What are you doing here?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.500
Me?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.270
I just have some documents
that need the chairman's approval.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.070
Well, if the chairman is out,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.710
isn't it common sense
to just come back tomorrow?

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.550
You're right. I was just about to leave.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.120
That's not what it looked like to me.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.420
It looked like you were searching
by the chairman's desk.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.120
You must have been mistaken.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.890
Was I?

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.230
Fine. We'll go with that.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.830
Since you're so insistent.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.700
I'm not being insistent.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.230
That's just what happened.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.350
He said he was here for an approval,
so why's he taking the documents with him?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.290
What the heck was he looking for?

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.690
You're acting more and more suspicious,
Moon Tae Kyung.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.270
Ma'am.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.770
Do you know why people go to
all the trouble of climbing a mountain...

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.610
just to shout "Yahoo"
at the top of their lungs?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.250
Why is that?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.380
It's for the echo.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.720
It's an exchange. A call and a response.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.350
What are you trying to say?

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.120
I made you a clear offer.
Why haven't I heard back, yes or no?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.290
I told you I'd pay
your husband's hospital bills.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.460
But, I can't just...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.460
I owe CEO Han so much.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.100
And I'm saying don't let that ruin you.
That's my point.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.540
Because I'm the kind of person
who can save a life, or destroy one.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.310
Your life is hard enough as it is.
Do you really want to make it worse?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.220
Whatever! I'm busy right now.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.550
Let's talk later.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:23.910
Excuse me.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.310
CEO Han Kyung Soo of Doeun Industries.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.780
I'm his son, Han Ki Cheol.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.820
It is you, isn't it? I knew it!

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.650
Of course. I never forget a face.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.560
But now...

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.660
I'm living under the name Moon Tae Kyung.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.330
What? Why? You have a perfectly good name.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.830
It's a long story.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.070
What kind of story?

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.070
Is it because of what happened
after your parents passed away?

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.140
Yes.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.240
After my parents passed away,
I had no guardian to take care of me,

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.580
so I was adopted by a family
in the United States.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.880
My goodness. You poor thing.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.150
You don't have to say another word.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.390
I'll keep my mouth shut.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.190
I won't say a word to anyone
about who you are,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.330
- so don't you worry.
- Thank you.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.330
I overheard that you're behind
on your hospital bills,

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.770
and I'll take care of them for you.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.570
Gosh, I couldn't possibly!

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.540
I owed your father so much
when he was alive.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.280
No.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.380
If my parents were still alive,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.710
they would have insisted on it.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.430
So he finally got his hands
on the last piece of evidence...

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.160
and plans to bury the truth about
my parents' accident forever?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.030
I'll never let that happen.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.100
- Why are you staring at me like that?
- It's...

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.970
It's nothing.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.910
The document Min Doo Sik got last night
was Tae Kyung's parents' contract.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.780
Really?

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.820
He said it wasn't at his house,
so it must be in the chairman's office.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.520
I told Tae Kyung to search there,
but I don't know if he has yet.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.990
But if he gets caught,
his cover will be blown.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.660
What was that about earlier?

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.830
That you were running a background check
on someone.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.570
What does that have to do with me checking
the employee personnel files?

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.770
I have a feeling they're connected.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.380
So you're saying there's someone here
under a false identity?

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.040
I said I would tell you
when I had something more concrete.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.980
So you do have a suspect in mind.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.420
Just tell me who.
We can take our time confirming it.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.820
I can't say much,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.160
- but they're someone close to you, sir.
- Right, so who is it?

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.430
Please, just give me a little more time.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.030
Unbelievable.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.440
How could he think of taking the contract
for Tae Kyung's parents?

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.840
So ruthless.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.710
He plans to die with his sins, doesn't he?
Just like what happened to our Mi So.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.210
What horrible people.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.320
Just thinking about Mingang
makes my blood boil.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.190
Hello?

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.490
Se Ri, sweetie. What's up?

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.690
I'm bored.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.800
We can't have my daughter being bored.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.900
Want to go for a drive with Mom?

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.580
And here I was, thinking we were going
somewhere fun.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.450
What's wrong with this place?
You get to see the chairman. It's nice.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.550
You really like my dad that much,
don't you?

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.620
But I love you more.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.430
What are you two doing here?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.700
Getting some air with Mom.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.700
Knock it off with the "Mom" stuff.
People will think she's your real mother.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:12.970
Why are you talking to a child like that?

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.970
Don't you dare talk to Se Ri that way.
I won't stand for it.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.510
Our Se Ri is too precious
to be treated like this.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.010
What did you just say?

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.250
"Our" Se Ri?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.150
That's right. Our Se Ri.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.690
My daughter.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.420
She's not your daughter, she's mine.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.620
Min Kyung Chae,
you may have given birth to her,

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.890
but she's my daughter now.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.300
Let's go for that drive.
I'll call Mr. Kim.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.870
- Okay, Mom.
- Wait. A word.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.170
What is it?
If you have something to say, say it here.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.310
Follow me!

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.150
Gosh, what's her problem?

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.910
Go on. Quickly.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.660
Why do you let that woman wrap you
around her little finger?

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.160
She's not "that woman." She's my mom.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.130
I told you not to call her "Mom"
in front of me!

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.130
Kyung Chae.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.770
You said to assume my birth mom is dead,
didn't you?

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800
Yes, I did.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.180
I've been looking for her so hard
and still can't find her.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.740
Maybe my birth mother isn't
with us anymore.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.710
But I'm right here in front of you.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.020
I'm your mother.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.120
I'm your real mother,
the one who gave birth to you.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.620
Well, if that's true...

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.230
I'll just believe that my mom in the stars
sent me my new mom as a gift.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.030
Don't be ridiculous!

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.030
Aren't you two done talking yet?

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.670
- We're done. Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.930
I swear, my head spins thinking about it.
If it hadn't been for you,

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.900
my husband here would be six feet under...

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.900
This is exactly why you need a young man
around the house.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.540
It was nothing.
I really didn't do all that much.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.110
What do you mean you did nothing?
It's such a relief nobody got hurt.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.910
Who cares if we lost some scraps of paper?

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.350
What in the world are you talking about?

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.620
That thieving bastard stole my safe,
and now my precious documents are gone.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:45.690
Gosh.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.630
You should put him on a pedestal.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.260
He saved your life, after all.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.800
No, better yet, you should just adopt him!
It'd be great to have someone reliable.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:55.870
What?

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.840
Adopt him?

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.140
No, of course not.
An adoptive son? Goodness, no.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.710
Why? Am I not good enough
to be your adoptive father?

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.010
No, sir. Of course not.
That's not it at all.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.150
You don't have that gloomy look anymore.
You look good.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.920
While we're at it, why don't we forge
a father-son bond?

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.790
Son.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.460
- Eat up.
- Yes, sir.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.130
- Eat up, son.
- Okay. You too, ma'am.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.610
It's me.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.750
I heard what happened.
It was your father's contract, wasn't it?

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.450
Did you check the chairman's office?

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.490
I searched, but I couldn't find it.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.160
It must be there.
Especially since it's not at the house.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.200
If I knew it was your parents' contract,
I would've kept it somewhere safe.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.570
No, that would've been impossible.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.240
If you get caught,
it will put you in more danger.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:12.710
I've had it. I can't stand
Mingang or Min Doo Sik anymore.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.780
How could they stoop so low?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.390
Shouldn't we be doing something?

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.190
At this rate, how are you ever going
to get Dad's shares?

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.560
I thought I told you to wait.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.860
You're supposed to be on your honeymoon,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.600
but Dad coming back late itself
is the problem.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.430
So what do I do?
Forbid his meetings with other chairmen?

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.870
Look here.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.370
You seem to be confused
about your role here.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.980
Your job is to get my dad's shares
and hand them over to me.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.480
Why do you think I went to all the trouble
of getting you to marry my dad?

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.820
I don't care if you're sly or seductive.
Just do something!

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.690
Is that really the best
you can come up with?

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.760
Do you have a better idea?

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.960
Did you really come here just to play
the part of the lady of the house?

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:06.630
Be patient.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.470
If you want those shares,
you need to learn to be patient.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.680
- Mom!
- Hey, Se Ri.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.010
I feel all stiff.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.080
Really? A hot bubble bath would feel nice.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.690
Want to take one with Mommy?

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.560
Really?
I've never taken a bath with anyone.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.330
- It's embarrassing.
- There's no need to be shy with me.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.330
I'll wash you.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.460
You just relax like a princess.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.830
- Let's go!
- Okay.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.640
Look at them.
One might think she gave birth to Se Ri.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.350
A real fate-touched mother and daughter,
aren't they?

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.620
They're so perfect together
it brings a tear to my eye.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.220
Shut it.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.690
- Don't tell me you're jealous.
- I thought I told you to shut it.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.160
Say what you will,
but since Lucia moved in,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.600
it's a good thing
that Se Ri has settled down.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.370
She's not settling down,
she's having her heart stolen.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.470
I don't know why you brought her here,
but you're going to regret it.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.180
Your plan? It's all for nothing.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.980
You've been barking up the wrong tree.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.950
What's that supposed to mean?

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.680
What's all for nothing?

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.530
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.740
What are you thinking so deeply about?

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.580
About how to kick that woman
out of the house.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.410
You mean Lucia?

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.020
Se Ri is changing day by day.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.050
She's becoming too dependent
on that woman.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.620
Well, Se Ri is the bigger problem,
not my father.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.490
At a time like this,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.730
joining forces with Director Min Soo Jung
could be an option.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.160
Join forces with Soo Jung?

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.700
Do you know whose fault it is that Lucia
married my father in the first place?

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.870
- What do you mean?
- I mean Soo Jung...

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.870
She coached my father into the marriage,
and that's how this whole mess started.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.240
But why on earth would she do that?

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.010
There's nothing in it for Min Soo Jung.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.180
Apparently, after Lucia married him,

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.920
the deal was she'd get Father's shares
and hand them over to Soo Jung.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.190
What? How could they
possibly make a deal like that?

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.390
And you want me to side
with someone like that?

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.300
I don't know why you brought Lucia here,
but you're going to regret it.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.800
Your plan? It's all for nothing.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.300
You've been barking up the wrong tree.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.380
What did you mean yesterday?
About my plan being all for nothing.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.960
Did you actually think a reckless plan
like that would work?

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.960
Is that why you set Dad up with Lucia?

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.830
If you hadn't gotten in the middle of it,
they never would have gotten married.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.260
Well, that's...

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.870
What does that have to do with my plan?

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.140
You pushed for Lucia and my father
to get married...

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.370
on the condition that she'd get his shares
for you. Isn't that right?

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.710
- How did you know?
- Did you think I wouldn't?

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.150
So, what now?

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.490
Do you know on what terms
Lucia married Dad?

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.920
She signed a share waiver agreement.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.130
A waiver saying she'll accept no shares
of Mingang stock from the chairman.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.000
What?

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.730
Do you get it now?

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.540
That means you get no shares from Lucia.
Not one.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.040
Lucia played you.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.480
She used you to pull off the marriage.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.360
What brings you here at this hour?

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.200
Where's Lucia?

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.800
Oh my! Soo Jung,
aren't you supposed to be at the office?

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.940
I asked you, where's Lucia?

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.530
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.630
What is wrong with you?
I'm married to your father.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.130
I'm your stepmother!
There's a limit to your terrible behavior.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.870
How dare you come in here
and cause a scene?

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.780
Why did you hide it from me?

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.310
Who do you think you are,
playing me for a fool?

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.950
I heard you signed that share waiver
with my father.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.220
No wonder you made no move
to get the shares.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.760
So what are you going to do now?
What are you going to do?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.860
- Who told you that?
- Kyung Chae did.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.100
I'm the only one who was made a fool of.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:45.140
I can just imagine her laughing at me
for being played by you.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.910
Do you really think Chairman Min Doo Sik
would have let me marry him otherwise?

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.480
Then you should have told me!

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:56.310
Whether I told you or not was up to me.
That wasn't a condition of our deal.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.120
The deal was you'd get his shares for me.
I set you up with a man so above you...

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.390
and after all my work, what?

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.790
Now you say that wasn't part of the deal?

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.760
That's absurd.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.590
So what do you want me to do about it?

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.460
Are you going to get the marriage annulled
or something?

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.430
Yes. That's exactly what I'll do.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.900
I'm going to throw you out myself.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.790
My goodness, what is all this?
A share waiver agreement?

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.690
Madam Jung did sign a waiver
before the wedding.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.790
Wait, "Madam Jung?"

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.160
Manager Gong,
since when was she Madam Jung?

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.800
I thought you called her "that woman."

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.800
Well, she is living with the chairman now.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.940
What?
If she's "The Madam," then what am I?

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.410
Hey, if you're going to change your tune,
you should've given me a heads-up!

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.850
So does that mean I have to call her
"Mother" now?

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.050
Right. I need to call my husband.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.690
A share waiver agreement, was it?

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.830
Here you go.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.770
The legal team has finished their review.
The partner deal will get approved soon.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.210
That was much quicker than I expected.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.710
Well, I'm always happy to help you out.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:35.750
By the way,

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.580
besides the name Moon Tae Kyung,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.850
do you happen to have any other names?

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.750
Like a childhood name or a nickname.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.220
Why the sudden curiosity?

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.030
Come on, I'm curious.
We're not exactly strangers.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.290
If we're not strangers, then?

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.800
Come on, after everything
we've been tangled up in.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.170
Honestly, it's just pure curiosity
on my part.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.840
Careful. Someone might get the wrong idea.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.300
I'd suggest you curb your curiosity.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:03.770
All right, then...

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.510
You're not some kind of undercover agent,
are you?

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.950
Someone who has to hide
their name and identity...

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.320
because they're on another
top-secret mission?

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.320
Seriously, don't you have better things
to do?

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.020
Legal Team must have a lot
of free time on their hands.

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.090
What's with you two?

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.360
What do you think?

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.530
About Director Moon Tae Kyung...

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.370
Don't you think
he seems shrouded in mystery?

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:32.870
Shrouded in mystery?

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.170
What are you talking about?

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.750
What do you mean?
What about Director Moon?

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.850
Let's just say I have a hunch.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.180
I've got a nose for these things.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.590
We need to talk.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.160
If you have something to say, say it here.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.470
When I say follow, you follow.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.500
What did you just say to me?

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.850
Your whole purpose for coming here
was to get Dad's shares for me.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.850
Since that plan fell through,
it's time for you to leave.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.420
Watch your mouth.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.560
Who do you think you're talking to
like that?

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.160
What, did you expect me
to call you Mom or something?

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.330
Why don't you just run along
and go to bed?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.900
Dad will have to find out, then.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.240
About the little deal we had between us.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.770
If Chairman Min Doo Sik finds out,
you won't get away unscathed either.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.480
I'll just end up being the bad daughter
who was greedy for her dad's shares.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.580
But it's a different story for you.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.420
You're the one who's going
to suffer for it.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.850
Because you deceived the chairman
with ulterior motives.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.460
So I'm telling you,
get out before the chairman finds out.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.460
And give you the satisfaction?
I'm the lady of this house.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.530
And legally, your mother.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.170
- Don't give me that "mother" nonsense.
- I told you to watch your mouth!

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.480
Become my father's woman.
I'll back you all the way.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.320
If that happens, I'll be your stepmother.
Are you sure you're okay with that?

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.950
I don't care.
Just marry my father and get his shares.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.760
Do whatever it takes.
Get me the Mingang Distribution shares.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.860
And what do I get out of it?

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.970
Just hand over the shares,
and I'll make sure you're set for life.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.800
What are you doing?

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.340
Why aren't you packing?

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.540
I said pack your bags
and get out of this house!

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.160
