[Footprints of Change]

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.770
[Episode 15]

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.070
Thank you.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.480
You're welcome.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.850
What's your name, little girl?

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.400
My name is Yuanyuan, meaning
aid to North Korea against the U.S.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.430
How old are you?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.030
I'm 5 years old.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.640
Where are your parents?

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.070
My dad is working.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.630
I'm playing by myself.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.530
Good girl.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.190
Don't make any noise.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.680
Take her home first.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.070
I'll be there shortly.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.870
Minister Wen.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.490
Ms. Yi.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.720
Yuanyuan.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.630
Daddy.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.130
Is this your daughter?

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.100
Yes, she is.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.590
Did you say hello to the lady?

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.280
She did.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.810
Yuanyuan, let's go home.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.130
Daddy, I want a sketchbook.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.210
A sketchbook? Okay.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.210
I'll give you one.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.240
That won't do.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.800
This doesn't count as a bribe, right?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.910
According to our rules,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.170
this counts as a bribe.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840
Let's go home first.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.640
I'll bring you a sketchbook
when I come back, okay?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.430
Okay, go home with me first.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.440
Your daughter is adorable.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.240
Your wife must have
such a noble character.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.750
When Yuanyuan was too young to understand,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.080
her mother passed away.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.120
I'm sorry.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.000
It's nothing.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.400
Good.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.440
This is the newly released

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.160
Jean-Christophe, Volume 4,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.780
right?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.960
This was Zhaoyuan's favorite book
when he was alive,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.490
but unfortunately he only read up
to Volume 3.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.290
Regarding Comrade Zhaoyuan,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.030
I have something to give you.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.610
Would you mind sitting for a while?

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.710
Of course not.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.440
Here.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.640
I know

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.290
this is somewhat cruel,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.400
but I think it's necessary for you
to know about

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.000
the cause Comrade Zhaoyuan fought for.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.870
These are

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.540
Comrade Zhaoyuan's interrogation records

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.620
and his final letter we found.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.010
He loved you deeply.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.040
[Pocket]

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.020
[This is the book Comrade Zhaoyuan read
when he was alive]

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.250
How long has it been?

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.430
Half an hour.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.060
That long already?

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.870
When will the power come back?

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.159
Can you fix this problem?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.290
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.990
I couldn't find the matches.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.600
Comrade Zhou,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.440
I'd like to discuss something with you.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.830
I want to

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.740
take our relationship

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.610
to the next level,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.600
a romantic one.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.760
That's so sudden.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.560
I need to think about it.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.140
Okay.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.480
I'll think with you.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.600
Think about it now?

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.000
Why do you like me?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.730
Because I'm a martyr's family member?

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.240
Not just that.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.630
I've summarized two reasons.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.830
First,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.030
before Comrade Zhaoyuan's identity
was revealed,

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.750
you were able to draw a clear line

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.870
and work hard

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.800
to overcome difficulties.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.560
I really admire it.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.680
Second,

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.010
I think you're a kind person.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.010
From my observations during this time,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.560
I see you care about the people
and environment around you.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.240
Some time ago,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.580
when I was working frantically,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.560
one night

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.560
I was on the verge of breaking down.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.310
It was you

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.180
who brought me dinner.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.600
You know what?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.230
That meal you cook

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.530
was the most delicious one

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.000
I've ever had.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.020
That was just cafeteria food.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:28.720
Mr. Yang.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.720
Sorry, we had another power outage.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.830
Why is it always you?

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.030
Straighten your hat.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.010
Straighten your hat.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.080
Why do you always have power outages
at times like this?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.270
I don't understand.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.200
Let me tell you.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.549
This is the most

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.630
difficult time for work.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.830
Why do problems always happen with you?

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.670
You... let me tell you...

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.200
Look around.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.750
Mr. Yang.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.440
-Who is as fat as you?
-Mr. Yang.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.030
Sir, thank you.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.910
You can go first.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.910
Excuse me, Mr. Yang.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.480
Yes.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.560
Could you stop getting angry all the time?

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.490
It's a bit scary.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.880
Comrade Zhou.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.270
I'm sorry.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.670
But

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.550
what just happened makes me
even more certain

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.670
that you are a warm

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.130
and kind person.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.840
Just now,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.120
you were able to help that electrician

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.270
get out of trouble.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.200
You know,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.200
if you hadn't interrupted,

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.200
that man would have been in danger.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.930
Your smile is beautiful.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.030
I have canine teeth.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.910
I'll take that answer as a yes,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.280
Comrade Zhou.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.250
Let's make progress together.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.840
This is the evaluation list

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.970
that our department

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.600
is preparing to submit.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.840
Four people meet the requirements

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.270
for years of service
and political criteria.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.730
Here are their background check materials.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.870
This list seems quite biased.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.440
You mean Yang?

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.110
I think with his experience,

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.670
he should have been promoted long ago.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.000
Let's leave it to the Party Committee
to discuss and decide.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.470
I've asked all the committee members.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.250
They have no objections.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.050
You're the only one
who hasn't given your opinion.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.600
I know

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.440
you're prejudiced against Yang,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.080
right?

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.880
It's not prejudice.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.170
It's criticism.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.440
I really don't understand.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.550
You're so patient with those capitalists,

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.270
wealthy ladies,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.840
and petty bourgeoisie

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.440
and can see their strengths.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.750
Why are you so harsh only on Yang?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.790
Why?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.510
Because he's not a capitalist.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.000
He's not petty bourgeoisie either.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.510
He's a member of Communist Party of China.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.080
His every word and action
represents the Party

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.210
and the government.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.550
Is it wrong for me to hold him
to higher standards?

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.600
Yes, I admit

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.440
that Yang can be radical sometimes

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.000
and has said some extreme things.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.670
But he's improved a lot now.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.790
For the sake of work,

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.150
he wasn't even present
when his mother passed away.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.800
That's exactly what he did wrong.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.000
Why didn't he go back?

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.240
Which part of the work here couldn't
function without him?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.030
Then tell me,

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.080
among these candidates,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.010
who has performed better than him?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.380
We're selecting talent.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.920
It should put quality before quantity.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.030
We're not just filling quotas.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.870
So you'd rather waste this position

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.330
than promote Yang, right?

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.390
Let me emphasize again.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.690
I personally have no authority

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.630
to decide whether an official
gets promoted or not.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.390
It's up to the Party Committee
to discuss and decide.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.150
But you have the final say, don't you?

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.960
Be straightforward.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.560
Do you agree to promote Yang?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.800
I don't agree.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.760
I've already stated my reasons.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.030
All right, Ms. Fang.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.290
Have some water first.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.820
[Shanghai Municipal People's Government]

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.120
Come in.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:56.870
Sir,

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.480
are you busy?

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.260
What is it?

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.440
For this department evaluation,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.640
my name is on the list.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.050
This is my personal statement.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.470
I was hoping you could

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.860
give me some guidance.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.270
A personal statement should be authentic.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.690
You don't need others' opinions.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.920
Yes.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.230
A personal statement

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.920
does require authenticity.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.360
However,

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.440
what one himself considers true

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.150
often differs from how others see it.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.920
For instance,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.270
last Sunday,

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.630
Commissioner Yan

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.050
invited me to his home.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.080
He told me a story.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.240
It was about

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.480
an ancient minister

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.670
who worked tirelessly to help his king

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.630
day and night.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.440
Yet he was considered too diligent,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.510
suspected of overstepping his authority.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.790
Not only was he not promoted,

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.030
he was demoted

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.200
and exiled.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.600
Don't you think

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.030
Commissioner Yan's story

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.550
is truly sigh-inducing, right?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.360
Commissioner Yan still enjoys

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.790
discussing history with young people.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.910
Sir,

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.670
I'm here

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.270
to

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.870
communicate with you

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.840
frankly,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.480
so as to help you understand me better

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.360
and eliminate any prejudice

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.930
or bias you might have.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.790
Please

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.090
give me this chance.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.910
You say you want to communicate
frankly with me,

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.390
and to have an open dialogue.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.650
But you start by labeling me,

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.770
assuming I have prejudice
and bias against you.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.550
Do you expect me to wear this label

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.880
while talking with you?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.200
Sir, am I

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.790
wrong?

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:42.840
Of course you are.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.200
Think about it.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.270
When you first came to our department,

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.070
I had high expectations for you.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.340
I gave you so many opportunities.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.320
But what did you do?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.510
Now all the people in the commerce
and industry realm in Shanghai

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.040
have complaints about you.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.380
Isn't it normal

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.210
that they

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.710
have issues with me?

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.430
If they don't,

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.360
it means

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.080
I'm in the same boat with them.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:13.910
Yang,

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.030
with your current ideology,

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.890
you are not suitable for this job.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.170
What do you mean?

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:21.960
For the public-private partnership

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.240
and capitalist transformation,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.000
I've devoted all my energy.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.030
I believe

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.460
I can make a difference.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.450
I'm doing this

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.440
to protect you.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.030
Do you understand?

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.910
I don't know.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.800
I'm going to report this
to Commissioner Yan.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:36.260
Okay.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.360
Go ahead.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.030
Go.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.200
Why aren't you more enthusiastic?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.080
Hello.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.000
Go.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.510
Don't go.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.270
Why go?

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.600
Don't go.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.870
Why not go?

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.600
We're already here, why not go?

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.630
It's useless talking to her. She won't go.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.600
I know her.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.660
How do you know if we don't try?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.240
Really, don't go.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.310
What are you doing?

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.570
Comrade Zhou Yunqing.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.870
Even if she goes,

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.440
there will be so many people there,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.480
including leaders and students,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.870
even Minister Wen.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.840
What if she embarrasses herself again?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.040
You make a good point.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.700
Minister Wen will be there.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.030
No matter anything happens, Minister Wen
will solve it.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.290
Why are you so worried?

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.050
Xiurong already said

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.840
she's petty bourgeois

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.080
and needs gradual reformation.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.480
You can't rush it. You're too impatient.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.420
Is Su Xiurong completely right?

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.080
Not necessarily.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.190
Why do we have to listen
to you about everything?

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.780
Listen to me about everything? When?

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.280
Since we started
our romantic relationship,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.210
have I eaten even a bit of green onion?

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.750
I give up.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.160
Also, let me tell you,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.160
I don't

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.200
like darkness.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.240
Our building often has power outages.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.390
I remind you every time

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.840
to bring matches.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.620
Then why don't you bring them?

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.480
I brought candles

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.510
with me every day.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.600
Why do you always like to quibble now?

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.910
Let me tell you.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.000
You always use

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.870
such kind of expression

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.750
to achieve your goal.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.360
It's not good.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.480
What are you doing?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.770
That's a huge mosquito.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.390
Let me see.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.790
What did we come here for?

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.550
To get her to join the event.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.350
That's right.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:47.840
What are you doing then?

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.510
Let's go.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.360
Come on.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.800
Right, you just use

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.600
such kind of

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.890
special tactics to demand

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.300
to achieve your goals. That's right.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.240
You're here.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:08.829
Qing.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.260
Why are you crying?

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.000
Yi.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.480
Next week is May Fourth Youth Day.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.000
Our department is holding an event.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.200
We'd like to invite you to talk about

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.960
Zhouyuan's glorious deeds.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.210
Could you come?

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.300
This is good news. Why are you crying?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.680
Ms. Yi,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.480
I came today

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.010
mainly to apologize to you.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.260
Regarding

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.640
the reformation
of bourgeois intellectuals,

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.310
I was indeed too impatient.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.030
My words were a bit extreme.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:37.920
It has caused...

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.400
Qing, come in and talk.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.290
It has caused

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.940
disturbance to your life.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.400
Sit here.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.100
Yi.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.060
Will you go?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.710
Can you come?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.720
I'll go.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.830
Really?

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.930
Yes, really.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.110
Mr. Yang.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.640
Yi says she'll come.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.440
Calm down.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.550
Don't make noise.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.030
This is a good thing.
Of course she can go.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:13.510
Ms. Yi Yi,

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.030
for this speech,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.550
there will be not only
teachers and students,

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.340
but also reporters.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.160
So we

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.110
have prepared a speech for you.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.830
Qing,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.100
have you eaten?

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.740
Not yet.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.160
Then I'll get you something to eat.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.490
Sit here and wait for me.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.360
Yi, don't trouble yourself.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.360
The speech mainly covers

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.330
Comrade Zhaoyuan's

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.720
glorious deeds

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.400
and his

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:37.720
daily life details.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.180
Yi ignored you, right?

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.510
It's nothing.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.790
It's okay that she reads from the speech.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.710
Come here.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.110
Come over.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.670
Eat more, please.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.270
Everybody.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:17.960
This is

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.310
the wife of martyr Zhou Zhaoyuan,

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.510
Comrade Yi Yi.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.790
Now,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.620
let's invite her to tell us about

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.070
the glorious deeds
of martyr Zhou Zhaoyuan.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.000
Let's give her a round of applause.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.480
Please.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.690
Teachers and fellow students,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.000
hello.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.090
Just now, Ms. Qing

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.440
called me Comrade.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.030
I really don't deserve such honor.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.640
Zhou Zhaoyuan and I

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.030
were a couple,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.150
but when he was alive,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.070
I didn't know his real identity.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:04.720
I didn't know

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.980
how to share with you his glorious deeds.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.640
It wasn't until a knowledgeable leader

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.420
gave me
the last belongings of Zhaoyuan that

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.710
I finally understood
the meaning of the saying

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.510
"Without the Communist Party of China,

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.590
there would be

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:24.720
no new China".

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.200
These were Zhaoyuan's last words to me.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.000
Dear Yi,

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.160
what I least wanted

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.790
was for you to read this letter.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.400
To die for our country,

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.830
I have no regrets.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.400
I couldn't sleep at night.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.320
Watching you sleep so peacefully,

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:08.880
I feel it's so good,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.680
and beautiful.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.840
When I left,

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.270
Shanghai was still in April,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.540
chilly in the mornings and evenings.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.290
You love to look beautiful

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.190
and don't like wearing too many layers.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.850
But at least don't catch a cold.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.700
When I left,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.990
you were still working on your designs.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.680
Are the finished clothes ready now?

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.110
You must look

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.730
very beautiful in them.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.710
Sadly, I'll never see that.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.040
When reading and working at night,

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.940
don't stay up too late.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.270
Rest well

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.240
so you'll have more energy.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.900
Due to the nature of my work,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.160
I couldn't leave you
any valuable possessions.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.790
If you face any difficulties,

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.440
you can ask Zihe for help.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.660
Please don't struggle alone.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.000
Revolution

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.400
is my unwavering belief.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.300
I have never regretted it.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.550
So please don't grieve for me.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.160
If there is a next life,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.240
we will surely be together.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.350
I go to the afterlife first.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.030
Take care,

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:38.940
my love.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.960
Zhou Zhaoyuan.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.920
Thank you.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.920
Not at all.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.930
I was just passing by today.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.030
I don't believe it.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.180
I know you care about me

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.070
and worry I might break down.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.700
You're doing very well.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.370
What touches people most

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.750
is always sincerity.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.880
I'm reading those books you gave me.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.430
Although it's a bit difficult for me,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.370
I'm determined to finish them.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440
I also want to know

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.530
what exactly is attracting
and influencing Zhaoyuan.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.110
Even though I don't fully understand,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.440
I can feel that

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.400
it's something sacred and noble.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.200
Welcome to

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.070
join us anytime, if you want.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.950
With my personality,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.970
I think I'd better not join you,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.290
but be a witness and supervisor of
the ruling party.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.460
Take care of your wound and get some rest.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.730
Comrade Zhou.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.750
Hello.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.350
Mr. Yang.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.590
Director.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.690
Mr. Yang.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.360
Hello, Director.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:41.710
You're here.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.590
Let's talk inside.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.400
No, no.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.350
We won't disturb Chief's rest.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.210
It's like this.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.370
I've seen you taking care
of Chief Yan these days

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.680
while managing your work.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.800
It must be exhausting.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.800
I wasn't sure what I could do to help,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.750
so I made

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.930
two dishes.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.020
Please try them.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.190
What delicious food is this?

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.370
You're flattering me.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.160
These past few days,

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.920
you haven't been guiding our work

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.820
and I've been feeling quite anxious.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.530
So I

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.800
summarized a few points

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.510
about ideological improvements
I need to make.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.170
I'd like to report them to you.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.350
Guy.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.410
I need to give you some advice.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.320
Work and

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.550
health are both important.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:21.220
Understood.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:21.860
Did you get that?

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.570
I got it.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.330
So you need to take care of
your health now.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.720
Only with good health can you
do revolutionary work well.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.400
Yes.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.710
Remember that, okay?

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:31.400
I will.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.290
Zhou.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.130
Comrade Zhou.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.440
Hello.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.210
It's like this.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.340
I...

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.430
I just read

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.030
your recorded documents.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.930
There are some differences
with the materials I recorded.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.930
Could I verify some things with you?

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.880
Did I make some mistakes?

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:51.590
No.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.490
Well,

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.290
we can talk after eating

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.930
or talk while eating.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.890
Here, take this.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.400
Take it. Don't be shy.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.270
He made this.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.860
Try his cooking.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.830
You're lucky

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.920
to try his cooking.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.920
Also, different people

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.090
have different

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.740
tastes for the food.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.150
Thank you, Director.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.510
Director.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.240
Have you eaten yet?

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.070
Don't be shy. I have some inside.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.270
Eat. Don't be shy.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.590
Okay.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.270
Thank you.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.840
I'll talk with her about work.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.530
You two talk. I'll go check inside.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.110
All right.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.310
Take care, Director.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:28.940
Go.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.160
Comrade Zhou.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.750
Director, I just mopped the floor.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.110
It's slippery. Please be careful.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.510
Got it.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.720
So, it's like this,

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.750
when recording,

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:37.640
well...

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.110
well...

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:41.440
Sit down.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.850
Director gave me food.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.980
Yes.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.310
I just mopped the floor.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.770
I didn't do anything else.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:00.920
Mr. Yang.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.830
I'll eat then.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.790
Go ahead.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.410
It has green onions, right?

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.200
Yes.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.790
I don't eat green onions.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.680
I know.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.400
There's another portion

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.660
without green onions.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.560
You made a portion for me too?

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.450
Yes. I see you taking care of
the Chief

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.910
while juggling your work.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920
You've lost weight.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.380
So I made a portion for you.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.850
No green onions.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:32.470
Eat up.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.740
I'll eat then.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.300
Eat.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.720
It's delicious.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.580
Good, isn't it?

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:48.620
Really tasty.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.620
So you can cook too.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.000
Yes.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.400
I like cooking for myself when I'm alone.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.800
I have a big appetite.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.640
I think I didn't make enough.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.730
Mr. Yang, you just said

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.100
there are some questions?

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.520
What questions?

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.530
For you.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.790
A pen for me?

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.000
Yes. Actually, your records are fine.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.640
But you need to practice your handwriting.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.880
Whose handwriting should I practice?

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.400
Let me show you this.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.720
This is my handwriting.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.510
Actually, my handwriting

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.030
can be mistaken for several masters'

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.070
calligraphy.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.240
But

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.770
I suddenly realized

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.590
if I only imitate others,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.160
I would lose myself.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.040
So,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.840
I developed my own style.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.920
That's amazing.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.590
Can I learn from you?

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.200
Of course.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.310
Let's eat first,

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.110
and after the meal,

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.770
we'll practice calligraphy.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.460
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.620
This is for your calligraphy practice.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.960
I can have the one with green onions.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.090
Let's eat together.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.620
You can cook too?

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.090
I live alone and enjoy cooking.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.110
Really?

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.140
I should

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.750
learn how to cook too,

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:37.930
and learn from you.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.440
Chang.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:01.990
Yes?

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.290
Are you busy now?

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.960
Not at all.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.760
Come, let's have a chat.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.790
Sir, please have a seat.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.440
No need.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.510
It's just a few words.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:10.960
I'll stand.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.480
Please sit down.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.130
If you don't sit, I won't dare to
talk to you.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.060
Please sit down.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:18.710
Alright, let's sit and talk.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.730
Let me stand. It's fine.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.200
You're standing while talking to me.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.600
What's that supposed to mean?
Want me to look up to you?

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.270
No, no.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720
Sit down and talk.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.520
Comrade Chang,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.310
stand up.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.380
Let's talk standing.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.660
We'll both stand and talk.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.580
It's like this.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.130
Ms. Fang

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.960
has told you everything, right?

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.880
Yes. She told me.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.890
She said you're extremely busy with work,

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.720
and I completely understand.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.720
You're a leader
with countless responsibilities.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.720
That's normal.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:59.680
Don't worry.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:02.340
I definitely won't
interfere with your work.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.160
Ms. Fang also said you don't like movies

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.690
but prefer symphony music.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.160
I've never listened to symphony music,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.200
but I bought a phonograph and records.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.510
Now I listen every day after work.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.480
I'm learning.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.160
Ms. Fang told you these?

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.550
Ms. Fang also said

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.220
I'd learn to cook more dishes

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.100
to ensure your balanced nutrition

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.580
so I can take good care of you.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.880
If Ms. Fang said all that,

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.790
I think it's necessary to tell you today…

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:32.650
Chang Huijuan,

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.270
the patient in bed 16 needs
your nursing care.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.720
Sir, I'll go attend to my duties now.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.640
After I finish my work,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.040
I'll come back to report my thoughts
to you.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.680
Ms. Yi.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.110
Fen's first mother-in-law is here.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.770
I just saw her at the entrance.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.590
What do you mean by first mother-in-law?

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.720
Fen is remarried.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.760
So her current mother-in-law
is the second one.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.830
And the first mother-in-law is

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.230
from her first marriage.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.510
What nonsense?

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:19.240
Fen's first husband died young.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.510
He died just one month
after they got married.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.180
Fen was a widow for about 7 or 8 years.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.380
She finally found a decent man to marry.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:28.640
Fen!

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.790
Run!

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.790
Where's Fen? Fen!

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.260
If our fellow villager hadn't told me,

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.920
I would've thought you were dead.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.190
I even went to the temple
to pay for blessings for you.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.130
-You went to Shanghai with another man?
-Ms. Tang.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.720
-You shameless bastard!
-Where is Comrade Su?

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.320
Comrade Su went to a meeting.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.310
Make them quiet down and sit.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.830
What are you doing? Stop arguing.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:51.630
Sit down now.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.200
Listen to the leader.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.240
Granny,

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:55.890
let's talk this through calmly.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:56.720
Who are you?

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.770
This is our family business.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.960
It has nothing to do with you.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.880
Fen's marriage is completely legal.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.540
It was approved by the committee.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.460
Enough!

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.200
What do you mean by legal?

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.000
Fen already has a husband.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.840
She's my daughter-in-law.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.420
She belongs to our family.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.680
Hasn't your son been
dead for 7 or 8 years?

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.550
She brought him bad luck
and caused his death!

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.610
Don't spread feudal superstitions.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.240
When my son was one year old,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.680
his father died.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.260
I remained a widow my entire life.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.000
You shameless woman,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.880
you couldn't do the same.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.960
She's not you,

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.310
nor is she Xiang Lin's wife,
the lamentable widow.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.830
You're Xiang Lin's wife!

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.830
You're the unlucky woman!

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.790
How dare you push our leader!

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:34.400
Girls, get her!

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.320
You shameless.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.440
You shameless.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.920
Get her out of here! Out!

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.640
You shameless woman!

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.680
Take her out!

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.550
Alright, everyone, back to work.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:48.010
You all go back to work too.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:49.680
Fen,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.730
are you okay?

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.200
Don't be afraid.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.060
You've done nothing wrong.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.110
Ms. Yi.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:03.460
I'm fine.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.740
Take a rest.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.150
It's okay.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.850
Editor-in-Chief Ji.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.679
Minister Wen.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:23.370
What a rare visitor you are.
Please sit down.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:23.900
Alright.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:24.570
Have a seat.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:26.989
What brings you to my office?

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:28.030
Here, have some water.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.949
No, well...

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.679
Sir, you're just pretending not to know.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.400
Your capable assistant

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.590
is coming to our newspaper office.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.510
Don't you know?

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.960
Yang Xue'an.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.929
[We hereby send Comrade Yang Xue'an
to work at your office]

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:48.230
He's going to work there?

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.880
Yes.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:50.760
It was arranged by the city leadership.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.489
He'll be working as a reporter.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.360
I see.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.960
What kind of person is he?

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.140
He's dedicated and responsible,

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.200
highly motivated,

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.110
with good writing skill,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.120
and is an excellent young cadre.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.670
That's reassuring.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.400
Now that he's so excellent,

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.260
how can you bear to let him go, sir?

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.150
Talent needs to circulate.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.450
Don't you agree?

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.240
You're highly conscious, sir.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.100
All right then.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.000
When the official transfer order
from the city government arrives,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.920
I'll send it to you.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.590
Good.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.630
I won't take up any more of your time.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:23.470
I'll be going now.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.950
Leaving already?

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:24.440
Yes, I'm off.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.230
Would you like some water?

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.890
No, thanks.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.670
Too much is going on at the newspaper.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.070
All right.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:28.550
Goodbye, sir.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.400
Welcome to visit me often.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.230
Sure, goodbye!

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.090
Okay, goodbye.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.150
He's gone.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.760
Does anyone have any potatoes left?

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.710
Give me a potato,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.300
and I'll tell you a secret.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.400
What is it?

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.190
Guess what?

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.510
Why is Ms. Yi

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.110
so worked up about Widow Fen

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.030
remarrying?

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.230
No idea.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.150
Ms. Yi has been a widow
for several years now.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.800
No less time than Fen.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.840
Who would Ms. Yi fall in love with?

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.290
That silver-spoon Fu?

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.030
Ms. Su already said it's not him.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.030
Of course it's not silver-spoon Fu.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.000
He is so rich,

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.630
and has several concubines.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.920
If he wanted some fun or an affair,

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.840
he'd go for a young girl.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.960
What kind of man do you think
Ms. Yi would choose?

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:21.970
She would surely

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.710
want another high official.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.320
But if she's now seeing a rickshaw puller

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.920
or some laborer, it wouldn't
be surprising.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.520
You know what I mean, sisters?

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.410
Yes, indeed.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.150
No wonder I always see her taking

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.040
Aniu's rickshaw at the entrance.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:35.920
You saw that too?

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.000
I saw it as well.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.780
Miss Yi Yi.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.730
Seems you're all very interested
in my private life.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.930
I heard you and Fen are
from the same hometown.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.710
Not exactly.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.350
I came to Shanghai very early.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.960
How did Fen's former mother-in-law

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.590
know she was here?

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.300
Someone must have tipped her off.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.280
What this person's intentions were,

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.190
I don't know.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.480
But I can tell you all clearly.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.150
This is the new China.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.720
The old feudal ethics and morals

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.010
will surely be buried.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.800
Those with ill intentions

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.290
will eventually face the consequences.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:13.770
I...

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.670
I didn't mean that, Ms. Yi.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.360
We...

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.300
we all like you very much.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.350
I just gossip.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.880
Ms. Yi,

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.690
you're not angry, are you?

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.850
Please don't be angry.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.030
You're not going to fire me, are you?

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.000
You can't fire me!

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.510
I have elderly parents
and young children to support.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.110
If you fire me, what will I do?

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.960
Ms. Yi,

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:36.140
if you really fire me,

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.000
I'll kill myself right in front of you.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.110
What's all this noise?

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:39.840
Wen Manli,

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.440
what nonsense are you talking again?

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.510
Try to go die?

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.440
Ms. Su.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280
Get back to work first.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.080
We'll talk after the shift ends.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.510
Stop.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.980
What did you just say about Yi?

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.890
I'm asking you.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.230
I... I...

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.890
Yi, what did she say about you?

00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:58.880
Nothing.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.610
I know your file very well.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.630
I'll deal with you later.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.990
Stop gossiping about Yi.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:08.740
Let's go.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.800
Alright, alright.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.860
Finish your meal and get back to work.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.590
Hello, Director Fang.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.190
Hello, Director Fang.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.590
Hi.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.350
Minister Wen,

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.760
could you come out for a moment?

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.360
What is it?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.760
Let's talk in your office.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.110
I'm in a meeting right now.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.030
Just two words.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:43.110
Go ahead.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.510
Has Old Ji contacted you?

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.980
If you don't want Yang to leave,

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.940
don't approve his transfer order.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.770
The receiving institution has come to me,

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.470
and I knew nothing about it.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:55.400
Is that normal?

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.400
Yang said you told him to leave,

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.220
so we naturally assumed you knew about it.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.370
So you're saying

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.510
that you

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.160
don't want Yang to leave?

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.510
Actually, he doesn't want to leave either.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.550
He's just pretending he wants to go,

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.600
hoping you'll ask him to stay.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.040
He's overthinking this.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.150
Alright, I understand.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.320
I need to go to a meeting now.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.650
I haven't finished yet.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.320
Why would your factory accept

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.610
someone like Wen Manli?

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.090
I know her file very well.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.510
She used to be a dancer at Paramount.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.110
She has absolutely no feelings
for the new society.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.840
People like her are just trash.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.100
If we don't take care of her,

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.490
her family would end up on the streets.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.240
New China is just established.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.380
We should contribute to our country.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.370
What about her spreading rumors?

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.640
Should we deduct her work points

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.530
and give her a demerit?

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.460
Fine, I'll handle this.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.640
Don't be angry.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.420
You two keep talking. I need to go.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.090
Okay.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.960
Yi.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.880
You

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.910
need to be careful of her.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.670
These rumors won't disappear

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:12.070
because you ignore them.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.590
I don't want to waste time and energy

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:15.710
on such matters.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.320
She can't hurt me.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.350
When rumors

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.210
are repeated a hundred times,

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.810
they will become the truth.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.360
You can't be that naive.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.440
Qing.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.070
You should go now. I need to work.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:36.920
Yi.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.840
I'm not leaving.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.290
What do you mean?

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.600
I want to stay and keep you company.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.540
What's wrong with you?

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.630
What do you mean?

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.740
You've seen the situation today.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.230
I need to stay by your side
to protect you.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:00.630
I'm afraid they'll smear your reputation.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.330
Your workplace is far from where I live.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.660
It's not convenient.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.130
What's not convenient?

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.960
There are buses.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.630
From now on, I'll come over
after work to keep you company.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.760
We'll keep each other company.
You won't be lonely anymore.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760
Are you serious?

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.320
Of course I'm serious.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.960
What's with that face?

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.390
You don't welcome me?

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.110
You know what I'm like.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.740
I'm used to being alone.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.610
Not used to living with others.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.110
I...

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.460
Am I like the others?

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.630
I'm Zhou Zhaoyuan's younger sister.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.670
I'm Zhou Yunqing.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.720
Whose idea was this?

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.040
What do you mean?

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.070
Are you here to care for me

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.340
or to monitor me?

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:49.230
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.030
Did Mr. Yang send you to watch me?

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.840
Why are you so prejudiced against him?

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.360
He wants to protect you and care for you,

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.670
afraid others might ruin your reputation.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:59.670
What reputation?

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.280
He just cares about you.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.440
Is he caring about me

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.090
or afraid I'll affect you?

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.100
What are you saying?

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.110
You're being unreasonable!

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.190
I don't want you interfering
in my private life.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.110
Is that too much?

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:14.190
Very much so.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.400
Yi Yi.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.880
You're a martyr's widow.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.620
This identity isn't just yours.

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.440
You can't disgrace the martyr's name.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.100
You can't be with another man.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:23.320
Zhou Yunqing!

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.070
What?

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.530
How can you be so feudalistic?

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.590
Even the factory women
are more progressive than you.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.440
You're talking nonsense!

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.480
I understand now.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.030
Go back and tell Mr. Yang.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.440
Thank him for his good intentions.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.150
I'll protect my own reputation.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.840
Also,

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.760
my affairs have nothing to do

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.890
with you or Mr. Yang.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.030
If you two are worried I'll

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.630
affect your bright futures,

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.930
then distance yourself from me again.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.440
I won't.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.800
I'm not leaving.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:48.590
You won't leave?

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.190
Yes.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.570
Then I'll go.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.450
Don't go.

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.670
If you leave, I'll tear up
your manuscript.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.870
Tear it up if you want.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.590
I'm not leaving anyway.
