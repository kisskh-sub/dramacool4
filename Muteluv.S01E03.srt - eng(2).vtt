00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.664
The person you need to make fall for you
is Mawin?

00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:05.220
Right? I’m not sure either.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.616
Let’s eat together.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.536
Didn’t you try to start a convo with me
earlier today?

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:09.344
So talk to me.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.448
I’ll let you guess what I was listening to.

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:14.392
You are listening to the radio?

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.390
But you are the first who solve it.

00:00:18.408 --> 00:00:18.984
Why didn’t you raise your hand to answer?

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.000
I didn’t feel confident in my answer.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.032
You believe in everyone, but yourself.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:24.104
Go and solve it.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.952
(If we didn’t need to study.)

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.368
(What would we be doing?)

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.320
(If we weren’t competing against each other.)

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:38.720
(If we were just living our own lives.)

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.368
(Would we wake up this early?)

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.592
(How long would we be competing with others?)

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.440
(Do we need to study for the rest of my life?)

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.024
[How are you doing?]

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:56.020
[Will we get to celebrate?]

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.352
[I’m not trying to pressure you.]

00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:00.000
[I just ask in case we need to book a caterer.]

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.240
[I just ask in case we need to book a caterer.]

00:02:01.272 --> 00:02:03.576
[So I’ll contact them in advance.]

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.864
I found him. He’s zoning out here.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.952
Err, why didn’t you answer my messages?

00:02:10.984 --> 00:02:12.584
I didn’t answer my mom’s messages either.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.760
All I do is solve math questions all day.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.328
I’m tired of it, Benz.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.968
My ranking has been unchanged for days.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.680
Hold on.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.224
Did you follow the fortune teller’s advice?

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.544
I’m not joking, Err.

00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:30.448
If you really want this scholarship,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.450
you need to make him fall for you.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.800
It’s easier said than done.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.128
We only spend a few days together.

00:02:35.152 --> 00:02:36.020
How can I make him fall for me?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.240
It happens all the time in dramas.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.312
Guys, it’s time for the morning assembly.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.640
Don’t forget it, Err.

00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:44.280
You need to make him fall for you.

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:45.496
I’ve got to go. Bye.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.176
How can I make him like me?

00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:52.320
A guy like him doesn’t seem to like anyone
but himself.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.000
Last night, I made a predicted paper
for the final exam.

00:02:57.032 --> 00:02:58.080
You should try it.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.576
I think you are the first person he likes
besides himself.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.160
Can’t they turn down the AC?

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:30.432
It’s too cold.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.312
Damn.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.248
Who came up with such a cheesy question?

00:03:38.272 --> 00:03:39.176
It’s so funny.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.024
Hi.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.560
Why are you grinning?

00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:56.128
That’s your question.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.800
Why did you give me your predicted paper?

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:05.648
We are competitors.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.600
Aren’t you afraid that I will outrank you?

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.976
I have no particular reason.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.848
If I like someone, I want to do it for them.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.112
Hurry and get better.

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:18.696
I can’t wait for you to outrank me.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.768
How is it, everyone?

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.784
Can you do the exercise I gave you?

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.160
Is it hard?

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.944
I don’t think it’s that hard.

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:36.528
I know you can do it.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.992
But this question might be hard for you
to score full marks on.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.032
Does anyone want to try to solve it?

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.424
Kaenpanya, you should give your friend
a chance to do it.

00:04:59.448 --> 00:05:00.000
I want a new face.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.760
I want a new face.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.088
Anyone?

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.504
Baromavidya, come up here.

00:05:05.536 --> 00:05:07.500
Come on.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.592
Come here.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.304
Give him a round of applause.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.400
Come here.

00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:16.024
He raises his hand with confidence.

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:18.020
I’m sure he will do well.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.256
Go for it. Do your best.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.000
(You believe in everyone, but yourself.)

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.776
(Try to have some faith in yourself.)

00:05:33.824 --> 00:05:35.912
(If you get it wrong, just do it again.)

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.432
(If I like someone, I want to do it for them.)

00:05:38.464 --> 00:05:39.120
(Go and solve it.)

00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:40.352
(I can’t wait for you to outrank me.)

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.760
(There’s only me in this room.)

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.160
(Hurry and get better.)

00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:44.080
(It’s not a big deal if you get it wrong.)

00:05:44.104 --> 00:05:46.488
(You believe in everyone, but yourself.)

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.776
(Try to have some faith in yourself.)

00:05:47.808 --> 00:05:51.696
(If I like someone, I want to do it for them.)
(If you get it wrong, just do it again.)

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.960
(Hurry and get better.)

00:05:52.976 --> 00:05:54.160
(Go and solve it.)

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.064
(I have no particular reason.)

00:05:55.096 --> 00:05:56.304
(There’s only me in this room.)

00:05:56.328 --> 00:05:58.008
(If I like someone, I want to do it for them.)

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.376
(Try to have some faith in yourself.)

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.504
Wow!

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.064
Concise.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.688
Complete.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.384
Perfect.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.240
I’ll give you a full score.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.424
Give him a round of applause.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.624
Good job.

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:25.152
I noticed you barely answer questions in class.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.072
You are getting better.

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:28.904
What is your name?

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.720
I’m Err.

00:06:30.744 --> 00:06:31.504
Err?

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.352
Give Err a round of applause.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.200
Err, well done.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.280
Good job.

00:06:38.304 --> 00:06:40.280
Go back to your seat.

00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:42.360
Good job.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.560
You’ve made your name.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.288
Nothing.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.016
I’m just happy.

00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:54.592
Happy.

00:06:54.616 --> 00:06:57.104
NO.5 ANANTACHAI KRAIKAEW

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.896
Er, you’re quite hungry for praise.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.904
You got praised by the teacher once.

00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:03.840
Now, you skip lunch to do the exercise instead.

00:07:03.872 --> 00:07:05.032
I ate a lot at breakfast.

00:07:05.056 --> 00:07:06.104
I don’t feel hungry yet.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.304
Fine. I’m going to have lunch. I’m hungry.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.912
Aren’t you hungry?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.624
Both boxes are mine.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.176
Take it.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.720
I brought one for you.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.664
Why don’t you go have lunch?

00:07:45.696 --> 00:07:47.464
Are the snack boxes enough for your appetite?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.728
I brought them in case you feel hungry.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.032
What else do you want?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:00.000
I already gave you a snack box.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.408
I already gave you a snack box.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.792
You can take this one, too.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:45.696
Hey.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.704
Do you want to play with us?

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.848
What?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080
Come on.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.896
Pornthep plays basketball every evening.

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:57.736
Yes.

00:08:57.768 --> 00:08:58.544
Hey.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.000
You have a plant, Mawin?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.632
You have a plant, Mawin?

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.256
It’s Err’s.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.008
Err is doing well.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.416
His ranking is moving up every day.

00:09:06.448 --> 00:09:08.420
Do you want to eat it?

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:09.400
It might help you do well like Err.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.544
Eating sashimi?

00:09:10.568 --> 00:09:11.568
Sashimi.

00:09:11.608 --> 00:09:12.080
Yes.

00:09:12.104 --> 00:09:13.040
It’s pretty much the same.

00:09:21.336 --> 00:09:23.340
I started to feel hungry again
after solving your question.

00:09:23.368 --> 00:09:24.656
It’s harder than our teachers’ exercises.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.440
Having a plant on your desk,
does it really help?

00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:34.180
Plants have good energy.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.664
My older brother got this scholarship
because he got good energy from plants.

00:09:38.192 --> 00:09:40.190
You want this scholarship
because of your brother?

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.576
Not really.

00:09:42.608 --> 00:09:44.168
My family likes competitions.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:45.880
My mom was a beauty pageant contestant.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.024
My dad is a professor
who competes for research funds.

00:09:49.072 --> 00:09:51.264
I guess my brother and I got that
from our parents.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.504
My brother once won an eating competition
on Children’s Day.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.712
That’s why you want to win this scholarship?

00:10:00.376 --> 00:10:02.160
That was my reason at first.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.576
But now, I’m not sure.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.792
To be honest, it’s fun to be in this camp.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.688
What about you?

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.120
Did you have fun spending time together?

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.208
Yes.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.144
What are you doing?

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.288
What are you doing?

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.856
Do you see my earphones?

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.736
Can’t you find them tomorrow morning?

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.192
No.

00:11:07.984 --> 00:11:10.952
I didn’t see you use them since we got back.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.960
Did you leave them in the classroom?

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.656
Why is a smart guy like you afraid of ghosts?

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.660
Why do you need me
to come down with you every time?

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.192
Ghosts don’t check our grades
before they haunt us.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.496
Huh?

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.576
But you listen to the ghost story show
every night.

00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:34.950
So I can learn how the ghosts haunt people.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.112
Really?

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.344
Why are you grinning?

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.312
You don’t act like yourself.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.752
What do I usually act?

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.864
I’m Mawin.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.000
I’ve gotten straight A's,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.328
I’ve gotten straight A's,

00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:01.584
in every semester,

00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:02.592
every year.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.760
Hey, can I ask you for real?

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.696
The morning will arrive in a few hours.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.920
Why do you need to find the earphones now?

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.152
It’ll be several hours before dawn.

00:12:13.168 --> 00:12:13.960
I can’t sleep without them.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.272
You can borrow mine.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.688
I have to use my earphones.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.840
You are quite choosy.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.520
I’m addicted to them.

00:12:25.552 --> 00:12:26.580
What do you want me to do?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.080
You should take off the earphones
and talk to people.

00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:35.696
Who can I talk to?

00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:37.240
I get used to being alone.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.000
You have me.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.328
What song do you want to listen to?

00:12:40.352 --> 00:12:41.144
I’ll sing it.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.336
♪ You're just too good to be true ♪

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.224
♪ Can't take my eyes off of you ♪

00:12:51.256 --> 00:12:53.856
Are you making fun
of both me and Mr. Chuchuen?

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.392
No, I’m just singing.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.392
I try to help you end your addiction to earphones.

00:12:58.416 --> 00:13:00.000
Tell me what song you want to hear.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.280
Tell me what song you want to hear.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.512
♪ I love you, baby ♪

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:09.816
♪ And if it's quite alright, I need you ♪

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.064
I didn’t want to have a secret meeting like this.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.912
But we only have a few days left
before the final exam.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.928
Don’t you feel anything?

00:13:20.736 --> 00:13:21.896
Feel what?

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.064
Since we arrived at this camp,

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.864
Mawin has been dominating the ranking.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.016
I’m asking you for real.

00:13:31.672 --> 00:13:33.280
What have we been doing?

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.424
I used to like singing karaoke with my mom.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.328
I sang every day.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.472
Later, I learned that I also like studying.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.496
It’s 2 am.

00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:51.824
Why is someone still in the classroom?

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.536
Mawin is a genius.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.512
He deserves to win this scholarship.

00:13:58.536 --> 00:13:59.968
I’m not saying that Mawin is wrong.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.064
I know he’s a genius.

00:14:02.088 --> 00:14:05.344
I’m just talking about our feelings that…

00:14:05.368 --> 00:14:08.496
It feels like our efforts go to waste.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.304
Because none of us will win this scholarship.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.624
Hold on.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.264
You are making a big deal out of it.

00:14:19.296 --> 00:14:20.800
Our efforts don’t go to waste.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.960
Huh?

00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:24.290
When you study, you gain knowledge.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.288
It’s normal
to have winners and losers in competitions.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.792
Can you enjoy it
like when you watch sports games?

00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:30.208
How can I enjoy it?

00:14:30.256 --> 00:14:32.896
I’ve been preparing for this scholarship for years.

00:14:32.936 --> 00:14:35.616
So you are the only one
who deserves to get it?

00:14:35.648 --> 00:14:37.384
That’s not what I mean.

00:14:37.432 --> 00:14:39.380
I just want to say that this is not fun.

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:42.936
I think we all need to calm down.

00:14:43.128 --> 00:14:47.120
I understand both Mhee and Mangpor.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.920
It doesn’t seem like Mawin put effort into it.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.088
But he can easily win it.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.720
Is that what you are trying to say, Mangpor?

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.000
It’s not right to say
that he doesn’t put any effort into it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.304
It’s not right to say
that he doesn’t put any effort into it.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.440
We all have our own way of studying.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.008
I no longer care what his way of studying is.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.440
I’m here to win.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.248
Did you come here to lose?

00:15:11.272 --> 00:15:12.256
Miss Mangpor.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.064
Ton.

00:15:14.184 --> 00:15:16.336
You should have known me the best.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.368
You know how long I’ve been preparing
for this scholarship.

00:15:21.392 --> 00:15:23.224
What are you going to do, Mangpor?

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.632
We only have a few days before the exam.

00:15:24.664 --> 00:15:26.320
That’s why I called for this meeting.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.408
I asked Err to spy on him.

00:15:28.424 --> 00:15:29.648
But Err didn’t find anything useful.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.992
Mawin is Err’s friend.

00:15:32.008 --> 00:15:32.784
He wouldn’t do that.

00:15:32.816 --> 00:15:35.344
But aren’t we all friends?

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.976
I think we shouldn’t talk behind his back.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.320
Mawin is not my friend.

00:15:41.336 --> 00:15:42.808
He’s my rival.

00:15:43.016 --> 00:15:44.352
Are you going to say it’s not true?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.088
Move, please.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.616
What are you doing here?

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.648
I should be the one asking you that.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.216
How could you…

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.808
How could you do this?

00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:33.104
It’s just a university scholarship.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.640
How can you go this low just to get it?

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.408
You need to get this straight, Mangpor.

00:16:48.456 --> 00:16:50.460
I never agreed to spy on him for you.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.504
You are not alone, Mawin.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.000
SEER, HOW CAN I FIX THIS?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.240
SEER, HOW CAN I FIX THIS?

00:18:00.272 --> 00:18:03.408
I DON’T WANT TO SEE HIM FEEL BAD LIKE THIS.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.760
(It’s just like other days.)

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.032
(I wake up and
go out to compete with other horses.)

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.040
(There’s no time for an injured horse to rest.)

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.464
Hey, how is he doing?

00:18:31.696 --> 00:18:32.784
Have you talked to him?

00:18:32.816 --> 00:18:33.848
No.

00:18:33.888 --> 00:18:35.528
When I went back to the room,
he had already fallen asleep.

00:18:37.384 --> 00:18:40.200
What about this morning?

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.752
Did you have breakfast with him?

00:18:42.128 --> 00:18:43.264
He had already left the room when I woke up.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.632
Where the hell is he?

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.176
I didn’t see him in the dining room.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.072
I was the last one leaving the room.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.000
Where is he?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.768
Where is he?

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.056
I’ll go find him.

00:19:02.096 --> 00:19:03.328
Where are you going?

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.208
The class is about to start.

00:19:04.232 --> 00:19:04.940
Go to your seat.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.280
You can’t miss this class.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.688
Your point will be deducted, Err.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.690
Where the hell is he?

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.856
It’s time for lunch break.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:28.592
Thank you.

00:19:28.648 --> 00:19:29.464
See you.

00:19:29.488 --> 00:19:30.152
Go have your lunch.

00:19:30.184 --> 00:19:30.936
Err.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.368
Why didn’t Mawin attend the class?

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.368
Was he very mad at us last night?

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.664
Does he know that his point will be deducted
if he misses a class?

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.136
I don’t know.

00:19:43.496 --> 00:19:45.140
I’m going to go look for him.

00:19:45.408 --> 00:19:46.640
We’ll help you look for him.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.944
Where the hell is he?

00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:09.496
I’ll go this way. You go that way.

00:20:09.528 --> 00:20:10.544
Sure.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.432
We can’t find him.

00:20:26.696 --> 00:20:27.752
What do we do?

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.736
No one found him?

00:20:30.776 --> 00:20:31.496
No.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.664
What should we do?

00:20:33.688 --> 00:20:35.160
The afternoon class will begin soon.

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.832
I’m worried about Mawin.

00:20:37.856 --> 00:20:40.832
But I can’t miss this class.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.848
You guys should go back to the class.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.088
What about you?

00:20:44.312 --> 00:20:45.528
I’ll follow you.

00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:46.720
You should go.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.696
Err, you can’t miss the class.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.376
I got it. Go.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.752
I should go.

00:20:51.784 --> 00:20:52.776
See you.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.064
What should we do?

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.000
What are you going to do?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.464
What are you going to do?

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.776
You should go.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.104
I’ll skip the afternoon class to find him.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.656
It’s just one class. It’s not a big deal.

00:21:08.864 --> 00:21:10.660
It is a big deal.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.080
You don’t have many points to be deducted
like Mawin.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.528
This scholarship is very important to you, isn’t it?

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.104
You can lose the scholarship
by just one point.

00:21:21.712 --> 00:21:23.710
Right now, I want to find him more than anything.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.704
(The last picture of the winner,)

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.984
(will it still be as beautiful as we’ve pictured it?)

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:13.352
(Or will the winner have no one by his side
after he defeats others?)

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.744
Why didn’t you attend the class?

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.904
What are you doing here?

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.384
Why did you run away?

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.590
What are you thinking?

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.624
You know that your point will be deducted, right?

00:22:24.664 --> 00:22:26.376
You could be disqualified from the final exam.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.072
What about you?

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:28.952
You are skipping class like this.

00:22:28.992 --> 00:22:29.696
Don’t you worry about that?

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.344
Yes, I do.

00:22:31.376 --> 00:22:33.340
I’m also worried about you.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.352
Are you mad at me about last night?

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.776
Can’t you give me a chance to explain it?

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.080
It’s not what you think.

00:22:40.128 --> 00:22:41.072
I’m not mad.

00:22:41.096 --> 00:22:42.416
Then why did you run away?

00:22:42.456 --> 00:22:43.856
I’m just hurt.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.328
It hurts that in the end, I still have no friends.

00:22:48.912 --> 00:22:50.910
Mangpor was right.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.112
A guy like me should be alone.

00:22:54.544 --> 00:22:56.540
You shouldn’t have looked for me.

00:23:00.464 --> 00:23:01.216
Yeah.

00:23:02.016 --> 00:23:02.936
I’m just being too nosy.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.368
That’s not what I mean.

00:23:06.368 --> 00:23:08.370
You don’t need to care about me this much.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.416
You can see me as one of your schoolmates.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.368
If you were just a schoolmate to me,

00:23:17.408 --> 00:23:19.264
why would I run around the hotel looking for you?

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.360
My mom would scold me if she knew it.

00:23:20.392 --> 00:23:21.488
I’ll miss my chance to win the scholarship.

00:23:21.528 --> 00:23:22.880
You know what?

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.840
I also got pooped on by a bird.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.728
I did all these
because I only see you as my schoolmate.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.584
What the hell are you thinking, Mawin?

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.712
Stop thinking that they don’t like you.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.736
They are all worried about you.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.216
Everyone was looking for you everywhere.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.368
Yes, everyone was looking for you.

00:23:51.408 --> 00:23:54.088
I’m also looking for students who skip the class.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.968
What the hell are you doing up here?

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.792
Why did you skip the class?

00:24:17.872 --> 00:24:20.392
If you have a problem,
why didn’t you come to me?

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.192
I told you I just want to rest. I feel tired.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:28.608
He followed me.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:38.168
According to the rules,
your points will be deducted.

00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:43.536
But you have been well-behaved all this time.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:50.376
The Kaenpanya girl told me
that you two are having a hard time.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.768
So she asked me not to deduct your points.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.688
But you did violate the rule.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.176
I’ll give you a punishment instead.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.640
Today is laundry day.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.904
Since you two won’t attend
the afternoon class anyway.

00:25:08.928 --> 00:25:09.760
Right?

00:25:10.248 --> 00:25:14.624
Collect your classmates’ laundry
and bring it to the laundry room.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.144
That’s not all.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.424
Wait until the laundry is done
and bring it back to your classmates.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.368
See?

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400
You got yourself into trouble.

00:25:25.608 --> 00:25:27.400
If you get sick, I’ll laugh at you.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.040
Boys, you don’t need to wait here.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.176
It will take a while.

00:25:31.216 --> 00:25:32.360
You can come back to pick it up.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.392
Thank you.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.640
What is that on your shirt?

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.000
It’s so messy.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.352
See?

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.856
Use this to wipe it off for him.

00:25:45.896 --> 00:25:46.488
Yes.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.000
Can I ask you for real?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.056
I know you’re a genius.

00:26:06.096 --> 00:26:07.792
But aren’t you worried about the point deduction?

00:26:08.384 --> 00:26:10.380
If I say no, will you be mad at me?

00:26:17.256 --> 00:26:19.260
I don’t want the scholarship.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.376
You know that I’m sent to this camp
because I got good grades.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.440
Mr. Jate never asked me
if I wanted to go study abroad.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.648
I think he saw you
compete many academic competitions.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.952
So he might think you liked it.

00:26:33.232 --> 00:26:34.528
But isn’t it a good thing?

00:26:34.568 --> 00:26:36.576
If you win an award,
you can add it to your portfolio.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.016
But there are other students who really want it.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.808
After I heard what they said last night,
I feel really bad.

00:26:48.528 --> 00:26:50.530
I feel like I’m stealing their spot.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.424
But everyone has a right to compete for it.

00:26:55.448 --> 00:26:58.048
The exam is held so we can give it a try.

00:26:58.088 --> 00:26:59.704
So we will know if we like it or not.

00:26:59.728 --> 00:27:00.000
You don’t need to feel bad.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.392
You don’t need to feel bad.

00:27:01.416 --> 00:27:03.390
You are only 18.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.072
Just give it a try.

00:27:09.872 --> 00:27:11.870
Don’t you really want this scholarship?

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.272
If I get it, will you be mad at me?

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.288
Probably.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.976
I don’t know.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.424
You know what?

00:27:22.456 --> 00:27:25.280
I want this scholarship so bad
that I asked for advice from a fortune teller.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.584
What did he tell you to do?

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.704
Don’t laugh if I tell you.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.632
He told me…

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.392
I need to make you like me.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.248
I told you not to laugh.

00:27:46.432 --> 00:27:48.000
When did you do that?

00:27:48.368 --> 00:27:49.736
I didn’t see it.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.328
It’s because I didn’t do it.

00:27:51.368 --> 00:27:52.776
How can I find time to do it?

00:27:52.816 --> 00:27:55.144
I’m busy studying all day.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.528
How can the fortune teller come up
with such advice?

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.000
I will get the scholarship if I do that.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.530
I will get the scholarship if I do that.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.680
Now, I believe that you really want it.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.200
To be honest, it’s my life’s goal right now.

00:28:12.272 --> 00:28:14.304
Do you have any goals in your life?

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.208
I just want to have a close friend
before graduating from high school.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.056
I’ve never had a friend, Err.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.768
I work hard to get good grades.

00:28:31.808 --> 00:28:33.480
I thought it would help me make some friends.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.208
But the better my grades are,
the harder it is for me to find a friend.

00:28:37.984 --> 00:28:39.980
I don’t think it’s about your grades.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.664
It’s about you don’t know how to socialize.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.416
It’s true.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.480
I’m suck at it.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.720
Why don’t you ask for advice
from a fortune teller like I do?

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.520
Doesn’t it mean
you already achieved your first goal?

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.016
Because…

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.704
you have me as your first friend.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.032
That’s true.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.592
Even if I get the scholarship,

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.440
I won’t be as happy as
when I have you as my friend.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.288
Did you wipe all the bird poop off?

00:29:31.632 --> 00:29:32.744
Yes, sir.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.200
Good, bro.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.176
How much do I owe you?

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.584
I don’t want your money.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.016
Just let me do this.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.504
No scholarship will make me as happy as
when I have you, Err.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.904
Okay. Thank you.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.184
Everyone, sit down.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.040
Do you know…

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.456
what terrible thing we did last night?

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.584
Just say what you want to say, Mhee.

00:30:29.616 --> 00:30:30.760
Stop beating around the bush.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.312
Fine.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.536
I will stop beating around the bush, Sugus.

00:30:35.136 --> 00:30:37.140
What I want to know is…

00:30:37.392 --> 00:30:39.456
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.912
I want to ask you.

00:30:40.944 --> 00:30:43.344
Are you here to learn
or to be number one in this world?

00:30:43.368 --> 00:30:45.600
You can’t scold all of us like this, Mhee.

00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:50.016
Last night's meeting was Mangpor’s idea.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.336
I was only there to listen.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.168
I didn’t do anything.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.224
Because we didn’t do anything.

00:30:56.248 --> 00:30:57.744
We should have stopped it.

00:30:57.776 --> 00:31:00.000
We let the nonsense talk keep going
until he heard it.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.208
We let the nonsense talk keep going
until he heard it.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.176
Golf is right.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.408
We know what we did was wrong.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.984
But we continued to talk behind his back
until he walked in.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.624
Although some of us don’t think he’s a friend.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.880
If you see Mawin as your rival,

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:22.816
then we’re all your rivals too.

00:31:22.856 --> 00:31:24.896
If I top the ranking,

00:31:24.952 --> 00:31:28.016
will the rest of you
have a secret meeting without me?

00:31:28.064 --> 00:31:29.648
This is what I want to say since last night.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.416
I admit that
I didn’t want to have a problem last night.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.872
I was also too afraid to say anything.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.384
But I didn’t agree with you.

00:31:40.408 --> 00:31:43.264
All of us here are competing for the scholarship.

00:31:43.296 --> 00:31:45.260
But none of us is as smart as Mawin.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.952
I know you all work hard for it.

00:31:48.968 --> 00:31:50.712
But we need to admit the truth.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.192
We all share an equal one-in-fifteen chance
of winning the scholarship.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.400
That’s only 6.67 percent.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.000
It’s not like we are going to die tomorrow.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.104
It’s not like we are going to die tomorrow.

00:32:00.128 --> 00:32:02.168
I want this damn scholarship too.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.032
I hope that the 6 percent will be mine.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.520
Aren’t you having fun?

00:32:06.568 --> 00:32:08.552
To make new friends in this camp.

00:32:08.576 --> 00:32:10.200
Am I the only one who has fun?

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:13.216
Huh?

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.544
Mhee.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.168
I know…

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.704
you did it because you are stressed.

00:32:29.008 --> 00:32:32.496
You are not a bad person, Mangpor.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.208
I’m sorry.

00:32:40.448 --> 00:32:42.450
I’m sorry to all of you…

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.600
for making you feel guilty
because of what I did.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.128
I’ve now realized that
this feeling is worse than failing an exam.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.904
Why are you crying?

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.856
Now I feel guilty.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.000
Then what should we do?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.232
Then what should we do?

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:07.160
I know what we did was wrong but…

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:11.336
Do you want us to apologize to him one by one?

00:33:11.376 --> 00:33:13.192
What do you want us to do?

00:33:13.576 --> 00:33:15.190
I don’t know.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.104
You guys are smart.

00:33:17.136 --> 00:33:18.930
You need to figure it out by yourself.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.944
It’s done.

00:33:26.976 --> 00:33:28.240
Thank you.

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:29.728
He wiped it all off.

00:33:29.768 --> 00:33:30.792
Your friend did a good job.

00:33:30.824 --> 00:33:31.848
Thank you.

00:33:31.888 --> 00:33:32.528
Yeah.

00:33:33.904 --> 00:33:35.440
You return the laundry to them by yourself.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.880
Why can’t you come with me?

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.936
Didn’t you say you aren’t mad at them?

00:33:40.936 --> 00:33:42.940
I’m not mad at them but…

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.384
I just don’t know how to act around them.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.848
Just go see them.

00:33:47.888 --> 00:33:49.240
They are not terrible people.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.808
I’m sorry.

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.320
This is an amulet
I got from my senior at school.

00:34:21.352 --> 00:34:23.376
I’ll give it to you.

00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:25.380
Please forgive me, Mawin.

00:34:27.336 --> 00:34:28.368
In case you feel hungry.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.536
Here.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.440
Take it. It’s delicious.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.432
It’s Iticha’s jersey.

00:34:35.456 --> 00:34:36.440
He’s my favorite footballer.

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:40.904
It’s okay. I get it.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:48.016
I’m sorry.

00:34:48.056 --> 00:34:49.536
I’m sorry.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.264
Stop crying, Ton.

00:34:51.304 --> 00:34:54.040
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.

00:34:54.072 --> 00:34:55.384
That’s enough. Come here.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.168
I didn’t mean it.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:13.744
Wait.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.744
Here.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.336
These are the questions and the solutions
we learned in today’s classes.

00:35:27.384 --> 00:35:28.464
I wrote it all down.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:35.088
Under the note is the textbook
from a tutor my school hired to teach us

00:35:35.136 --> 00:35:37.616
and the textbook my dad translated for me.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.608
My dad is a teacher.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.232
It’s okay.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.216
You don’t need to do this.

00:35:44.248 --> 00:35:45.248
I’m not mad at you.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.688
Whether you are mad or not, just take it.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.832
I feel really bad for what I did to you.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.432
Are you really not mad at me?

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.264
I really want to be your friend.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.840
If you are mad at me, just say it.

00:36:05.864 --> 00:36:07.144
So I can make it up to you.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.864
I knew it.

00:36:09.888 --> 00:36:11.860
We did help her practice it.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.432
You don’t need to do that.

00:36:15.464 --> 00:36:16.920
I’m not mad at you.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.376
Please tell this to other friends too.

00:36:21.408 --> 00:36:23.008
After the exam,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.272
let’s invite Err to play board games with us.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.200
What are you doing here?

00:36:29.224 --> 00:36:29.900
Go in.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.608
Really?

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.856
She cried?

00:36:39.888 --> 00:36:41.112
You did well, Mhee.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.488
(I told you they were only stressed
because the exam is coming.)

00:36:45.528 --> 00:36:47.480
(They are not terrible people.)

00:36:48.408 --> 00:36:50.410
What you said is probably true.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:52.832
I’ve got to go.

00:36:52.856 --> 00:36:54.368
I think Mawin is back.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.600
Yeah. Bye.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:58.544
Do you want to eat it?

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.000
Are you a monk receiving alms?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.056
Are you a monk receiving alms?

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.168
Pornthep kissed me on the cheek.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.432
He really likes you.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.648
But not as much as Ton likes you.

00:37:11.704 --> 00:37:14.288
Every time he sees me,
he keeps talking about you.

00:37:14.328 --> 00:37:15.712
He praises you non-stop.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.448
Does he like me that much?

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:20.680
Do you mean Ton?

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:22.976
Yes.

00:37:23.672 --> 00:37:25.670
Yes, he really likes you.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.896
Ton likes me?

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.776
Why are you smiling?

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:35.216
What? I’m just smiling.

00:37:35.256 --> 00:37:36.792
Stop smiling.

00:37:36.832 --> 00:37:38.224
Why can’t I smile?

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.400
Stop smiling.

00:37:39.432 --> 00:37:40.800
I’m smiling because of Ton.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.072
No, stop smiling.

00:37:43.096 --> 00:37:43.976
Then what do you want me to do?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.968
Stand still.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.440
Yeah, stand still.

00:37:48.704 --> 00:37:49.976
No.

00:37:50.752 --> 00:37:52.032
Why are you hitting me?

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.272
Didn’t you say you were going to finish this one?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.192
Hey.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.848
Can you show me how to solve it?

00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:14.816
I’m lost.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.392
Hey.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.048
It’s great. Today is the last day of tutoring.

00:39:53.096 --> 00:39:54.370
We only have a class for half a day.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.504
What will we do in the afternoon?

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.000
I don’t know.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.000
Ton.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.848
Ton.

00:40:00.888 --> 00:40:01.488
Yes.

00:40:01.536 --> 00:40:03.080
What is our schedule in the afternoon?

00:40:03.112 --> 00:40:04.752
I think we have an activity to do.

00:40:04.784 --> 00:40:06.192
But I’m not sure either.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.544
There will be a BBQ party at the pool.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.200
Say it the way we’ve practiced.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.600
There will be a BBQ party at the pool.

00:40:22.632 --> 00:40:24.536
They will give us the camp’s souvenir t-shirts.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.640
Ton.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.384
Stop pressuring me.

00:40:33.416 --> 00:40:34.928
This is how my natural voice sounds.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.624
Will you leave a message on my shirt?

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:56.920
What are you going to do?

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.944
It is what it is.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.552
Today is not my day.

00:41:01.576 --> 00:41:02.704
I’ll try again tomorrow.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.368
There are other academic competitions for us.

00:41:19.096 --> 00:41:20.632
Is that chocolate flavor?

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.440
Why am I fighting with my babe today?

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.280
We have an exam tomorrow.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.776
How can I work things out?

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:34.472
What about you?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.224
Don’t you have one?

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.992
A babe?

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:41.840
You have been with me for over ten days.

00:41:41.872 --> 00:41:43.648
Have you ever seen me talking on a phone
with someone else besides my mom

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.056
That’s true.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.440
What about you?

00:41:49.488 --> 00:41:50.376
Don’t you have one?

00:41:52.432 --> 00:41:54.504
Have you ever seen me
talking to anyone else but you?

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.960
What should I do?

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.704
Two squared…

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:17.608
Hey, Benz.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:19.896
How are you doing?

00:42:19.928 --> 00:42:21.448
I see you looking down all week.

00:42:21.496 --> 00:42:23.736
When will Err come back to school?

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.592
He’ll be back in a few days.

00:42:25.624 --> 00:42:26.096
Really?

00:42:26.136 --> 00:42:28.784
Do you remember Seer TK?

00:42:28.824 --> 00:42:30.216
I shared his contact info with you.

00:42:30.256 --> 00:42:31.120
Of course.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.160
Why?

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.896
You and I used to argue
whether he was a human or a bot.

00:42:35.952 --> 00:42:37.592
He’s actually a human.

00:42:37.616 --> 00:42:39.344
You are right.

00:42:39.376 --> 00:42:42.344
See? I told you he’s not a bot.

00:42:42.376 --> 00:42:43.952
How can a bot give spot-on predictions?

00:42:44.008 --> 00:42:45.832
I also heard that…

00:42:45.848 --> 00:42:50.816
he might be one of the students in our school.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:51.768
Huh?

00:42:53.328 --> 00:42:55.648
Yes. That’s what I heard.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.600
What do you think?

00:42:57.648 --> 00:43:00.000
I think he’s one of the senior students
based on how he talks.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.976
I think he’s one of the senior students
based on how he talks.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.840
That’s what I think.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.840
This camp is like a finite set.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.544
But your memories are like infinity.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.928
Our class,

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.592
it’s over.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:20.920
Alright.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.816
Since today is the last day of our class.

00:43:23.856 --> 00:43:26.904
I want to give you all my well wishes.

00:43:26.928 --> 00:43:31.776
I wish you the best of luck
on the path that you choose.

00:43:31.816 --> 00:43:34.112
I don’t know which one of you will be number one.

00:43:34.136 --> 00:43:41.360
I hope all of you will be full of energy
to fight for what you want.

00:43:41.392 --> 00:43:45.720
Thank you for your hard work
that brought you here together.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.176
Thank you.

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.856
Err, help me.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.000
Is Mhee your friend from junior high?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:00.104
Is Mhee your friend from junior high?

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.784
Yes, he studied at Baromavidya like us.

00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:05.896
He moved to attend high school
at the same school as his older brother.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:07.384
There.

00:44:07.416 --> 00:44:08.220
Here.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:11.368
All your friends are weird.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:12.760
I’m not surprised.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.640
Why?

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.080
Don’t you want to go play with them?

00:44:21.552 --> 00:44:22.320
No.

00:44:22.672 --> 00:44:23.792
I’ll sit here with you.

00:44:31.736 --> 00:44:33.408
Why are you so nice to me?

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.472
You helped me a lot.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.512
Without your help, I wouldn’t be ranked No. 4.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:45.920
You can do it.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:48.480
I always know you can do it.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.512
You just need to believe in yourself.

00:44:51.536 --> 00:44:52.920
Stop listening to others.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.016
You are the only one who tells me this.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.000
Tell you what?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.168
Tell you what?

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.272
You always tell me I can do it.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:08.136
I really think that.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.192
It’s okay if you don’t believe in yourself.

00:45:11.216 --> 00:45:12.528
But you can trust me.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:16.320
I believe that you can do it.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:25.768
You tell me the same thing
my fortune teller said to me.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.600
The fortune teller who told you
that I need to fall for you?

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.496
Yes.

00:45:32.528 --> 00:45:33.792
You talk like him.

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.528
Are you the fortune teller?

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.544
What if I were him?

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:41.952
What would you do?

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.072
All I need to do is fall for you, right?

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.560
What?

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.824
If I fall for you,

00:45:54.864 --> 00:45:56.616
you will get this scholarship, right?

00:46:03.088 --> 00:46:05.090
I’ll fall for you right now.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.128
Are you crazy?

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.130
What the fortune teller said is nonsense.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.472
But I’m serious.

00:46:14.496 --> 00:46:15.480
I like you.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.072
Do you like me, Err?

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.536
Because I’m falling hard for you.

00:46:54.888 --> 00:46:56.360
Don’t come near me.

00:46:56.392 --> 00:46:57.536
I can’t swim.

00:46:57.568 --> 00:46:59.064
Don’t push me.

00:46:59.096 --> 00:47:00.000
Catch his legs.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.104
Catch his legs.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.656
This is dangerous.

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:05.816
Are you really on my side?

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.216
I’m sad. I got dumped.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.544
What the heck?

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.440
Where are Err and Mawin?

00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:15.752
Right, where are they?

00:47:15.776 --> 00:47:17.750
Come here.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.096
Come and join us.

00:47:21.136 --> 00:47:23.664
Where have you been?

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.576
Do you really want to go?

00:48:13.608 --> 00:48:14.352
Go where?

00:48:14.376 --> 00:48:15.384
Go study abroad.

00:48:15.408 --> 00:48:17.704
If I submit a blank answer sheet tomorrow,
you will get the scholarship.

00:48:17.736 --> 00:48:18.816
Why didn’t you read my messages?

00:48:18.832 --> 00:48:19.824
This is a big deal.

00:48:19.848 --> 00:48:21.568
Seer TK that you’ve been chatting with…

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.570
Before you went to the camp,
you two didn’t like each other.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.392
But when you came back,
it looks like you hate each other.

00:48:25.424 --> 00:48:27.040
Aren’t you going to explain it to me?

00:48:27.072 --> 00:48:28.032
Just say what is on your mind.

00:48:28.064 --> 00:48:29.464
I’ve told you everything, Err.

00:48:29.512 --> 00:48:32.016
What I think, how I feel, I told you everything.

00:48:32.056 --> 00:48:33.040
Do you still like me?

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.264
Can you continue to like me for another four years?

00:48:34.288 --> 00:48:34.880
Tell me what you want me to do.

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:35.688
I’ll do anything.

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:37.392
Do you want to be a fortune teller’s boyfriend?
