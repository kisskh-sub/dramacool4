[Episode 16]

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.200
Actually, all I wanted was

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.920
to keep her company.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.060
I was afraid she'd be lonely

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.460
or that she'd be bullied.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.729
Who knew she would react so strongly?

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.430
Actually,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.430
I get what Yang meant.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.640
He's just worried your sister-in-law

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.470
might fall for some shady man

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.750
and tarnish

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.310
the name of a martyr's widow.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.800
Right?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.110
Mr. Yang definitely meant well.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.710
I know

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.360
my brother and sister-in-law
truly loved each other.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.680
She would never love another man.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.570
Director Fang,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.560
what do you think?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.190
I don't know.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.800
So you're saying

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.530
she might fall for another man?

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.360
Hard to say.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.450
Then I'll go talk to her!

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.400
Well,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.190
are you suggesting

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.079
that you expect her to remain a widow

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.520
for the rest of her life?

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.560
You're a Communist Youth League member.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.750
This kind of idea isn't right.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.520
It's feudal thinking

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.630
that should be criticized.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.430
But I just can't get over it.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.310
The thought of her with another man…

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.910
I...

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.680
I feel uncomfortable.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.470
It upsets me.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.460
You understand me, right?

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.560
Young comrade,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.080
you're quite adorable.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.940
Director Fang says I'm adorable.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.680
Ms. Yi,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.190
may I share my thoughts

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.280
about this design draft?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.630
Of course.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.030
I might not be right.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.720
I actually wanted to say this last time.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.750
I think this design

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.020
isn't quite complete yet.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.700
On the surface, it looks fine,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.030
but somehow it lacks a bit of...

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.470
character.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.680
Ms. Su,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.150
I feel the same.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.710
That's why I've been delaying submission.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.160
I've been stuck at home lately,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.690
no inspiration at all.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.280
Then get out for a walk.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280
Haven't you been out for a long time?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.520
Is that allowed?

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.710
Of course it is.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.120
That's great!

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.840
My bike's broken.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.370
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.170
Okay.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.220
What are you doing?

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.760
Fixing the bike.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.159
Xiurong said

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.370
the chain fell off.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.610
Turns out the tire's flat too.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.040
Where did you ride this nice bike to,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.240
getting it like this?

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.390
To the mountains.

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.020
The mountains?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.600
How did you get the bike back?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720
I carried it.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.040
You?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.270
Yes, me.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.920
Once I fix this bike,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.070
no matter how you ride it in the future,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.800
the chain won't come off again.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.640
Don't carry it next time.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.670
With those skinny arms and legs,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.210
you might fall into a ditch.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.680
Are you worried about me?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.430
Yes.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.820
But you're not fixing my bike.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.720
You—

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.070
You're lying.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.120
This is your bike.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.480
Are you kidding me?

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.140
Don't touch it.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.880
It's dirty.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.750
Scholar.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.400
Haven't had hot oil noodles
for a long time, right?

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.430
Yeah.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.040
What's up?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.920
Do you remember Sun from the mess hall?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.630
I do.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.600
He made the best hot oil noodles.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.510
His whole family has moved here.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.560
They moved to Shanghai?

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.270
Yes.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.360
Really?

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.240
Really.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.160
Where?

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.200
Right under the bridge.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.120
Look.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.680
-It's over there.
-That one.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.920
We can't show up empty-handed.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.480
There was a pastry shop on the way.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.120
Here.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.560
Buy some snacks for the kids.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.390
I have money.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.830
Come on, put that away.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.920
You really do?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.430
I'll go.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.190
Okay.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.750
You go ahead first.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.880
Is the pen good to use?

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.680
Minister...

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.180
Minister Wen, what...

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.640
What are you doing here?

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.560
An old comrade opened a noodle shop here.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.160
We came for a bowl of noodles.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.220
I saw you drawing from a distance,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.770
so I came over to take a look.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.690
You haven't answered my question yet.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.730
What question?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.480
The pen,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.310
is it good?

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.950
It's good.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.360
I've been using it a lot lately.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.270
Did you draw this?

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.270
May I see it?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.270
Just a casual sketch.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.560
You like drawing people?

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.040
I think sometimes people,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.290
in their natural, lively moments,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.720
really move me.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.040
I don't know art,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.240
but I believe everything
in this world is connected.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.560
Every piece of work

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.490
reflects the creator's
state of mind at that moment.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.510
Am I right?

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.040
You draw very well.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.750
You always support me.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.570
Actually,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.630
your support means a lot to me.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.330
There have been many times when I felt

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.850
I couldn't go on anymore.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.560
But then I think,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.950
there's still someone like you,
a leader who's cultured,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.610
well-mannered and selfless,

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.750
and I'd feel at peace.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.690
At least there's still someone

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.159
who understands people like us.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.150
Scholar,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.030
I was wondering where you went.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.940
Turns out here you are, hiding...

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.750
hiding such a beauty.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.230
Don't talk nonsense!

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.660
That's not funny!

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.860
Do you know who she is?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.840
Zhou Zhaoyuan I told you about,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.610
and this is Ms. Yi Yi.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.390
Apologize to her.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.670
No need.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.400
No, no.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.840
I should apologize.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.380
I'm sorry,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.240
Ms. Zhou.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:15.960
No, I mean,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.980
Ms. Yi, right?

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.030
You know,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.750
our comrades who worked underground

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.080
deserve great respect,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.440
and their families

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.840
are even more admirable.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.630
I'm sorry,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.360
I spoke too rashly.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.670
It's fine.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.080
Well,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.510
I'm Zhao Hangong,

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.310
Wen's comrade-in-arms.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.680
We've been through
life and death together.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.560
Hello.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.630
Hello.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.380
Hello.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.240
Did you buy the gift?

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.000
Yes, I did.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.660
So let's...

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.630
Shall we...

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.240
How about

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.240
we go to my old comrade's noodle shop

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.440
for a bowl of noodles?

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.380
Have some noodles.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:51.410
Yes.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.770
It's quite special.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.300
-Let's go together.
-The noodles are so good.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.320
I'll... I'll go ahead.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.240
I'll go first

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.770
to order.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:02.850
Let's go.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.800
Let me take it.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.960
Sun's cooking

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.250
looks great.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.150
Not bad.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.270
Ms. Yi,

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.390
wait, you need to mix it first.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.910
Mix it well before eating.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.370
It tastes better that way.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.910
Not like that.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.870
Well,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.630
let me help.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:36.390
Come on.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.620
You see,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.750
with hot oil noodles,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.360
mixing is the key.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.150
You need to mix it hard.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.790
It tastes better
when everything is fully blended.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.400
Here.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.510
-Thank you, Minister Wen.
-Try it.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.240
After finishing the noodles,
have a bowl of soup.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.750
What boils together, digests together.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.610
Perfect match.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:54.790
Okay.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.480
Comrade Yi,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:01.980
you don't mind

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.030
if I call you that, do you?

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.360
Go ahead, Comrade Zhao.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.840
Alright then.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.390
Actually,

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.310
confirming Comrade Zhaoyuan's identity—

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.670
Wen really

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.120
put in a lot of effort.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.360
It wasn't easy at all.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.630
Zhao,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.480
can we not talk about this?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.080
Eat.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.320
Minister Wen,

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.790
let Comrade Zhao finish.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.390
I'd like to know more about Zhaoyuan too.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.920
I'm just telling the truth.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:26.960
Wen

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.390
had us

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.480
investigate

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.500
Comrade Zhou Zhaoyuan's identity.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:33.910
We went to the local archives

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.570
and reviewed many documents.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.910
Honestly,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.480
without Wen's help,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.680
confirming Zhaoyuan's identity

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.270
would have taken forever.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.670
So you helped confirm Zhaoyuan's identity?

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.500
Actually, at first

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.150
I learned from you that

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.230
Comrade Zhaoyuan
had excellent artistic taste.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.300
Later, I happened to chat with Fu Zihe

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.400
and found out

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.620
that he lived very frugally.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.750
Once when they were
having a meal together,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.750
he noticed

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.790
that Zhaoyuan's sock had a hole in it

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.390
which he had mended himself.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.910
His sock had a hole in it?

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.120
I didn't even know that.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.510
Also,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.690
we learned that

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.240
among the high-ranking KMT officers,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.270
there are many of our own comrades

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.270
who are frugal

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.840
and highly cultured.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.350
Following that lead,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.670
I found him

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.340
and proved that

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.750
your husband, Comrade Zhaoyuan,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.750
was one of us.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.160
I want to thank you on behalf of Zhaoyuan,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.640
and for Qing and myself as well.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.510
Eat now.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.770
The noodles will get sticky soon.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.340
Thank you.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.430
I... I want some soup too.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:23.790
Okay.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.060
Here's for you.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.120
Okay, thanks.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.270
Perfect match indeed.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:39.920
By the way,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.950
Yuanyuan's birthday

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:42.840
is in a couple of days,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.440
right?

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.250
How do you know?

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.320
My son told me.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.240
Oh, right.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.840
Isn't it just one day
apart from Huzi's birthday?

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.790
Now I remember.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.720
That's true.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.700
Then...

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.720
Let them celebrate together.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.030
Yes, bring Huzi over

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.030
and let the kids celebrate
their birthdays together.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.670
Yi,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.720
would you like to join us?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.240
Me?

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.270
Yes,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.190
why don't you come along?

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.270
You know

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.050
my daughter Yuanyuan anyway.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.380
Come celebrate her birthday.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.010
Join us.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.750
You already know each other.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.500
Can you drive slower?

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.080
It's too bumpy.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.550
Wen,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.120
you didn't complain

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.780
when you used to ride in my car.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.870
Slow down.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.360
Slow down?

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.150
Alright.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.300
I'll slow down.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.200
Uh-oh. Broke down again.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.270
Hold on.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:29.750
Overheated, right?

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.410
It's definitely overheated.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.200
Is it the car can't handle
so many people?

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.080
Maybe I should just bike back instead.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.040
Don't worry.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.240
The car overheating

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.000
has nothing to do with the extra weight.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.400
It just needs to cool off.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.450
What's wrong?

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.270
The spark plug wire snapped.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.240
Can you fix it?

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.600
Can I fix it?

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.770
That's nothing.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.030
Nothing.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.550
He's excellent at fixing cars.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.230
You'll see.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.360
Comrade Yi,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.520
don't underestimate my old buddy here.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.340
This is a jeep captured from the Japanese.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.870
This old buddy

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.510
has quite a history.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.910
It served in
the War of Resistance Against Japan

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.240
and the Liberation War.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.270
If not for its condition,

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.840
it would have joined the Korean War.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.550
Really?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.000
Yes.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.800
Look at these bullet holes.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.870
It was hit by machine guns,

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.600
bombs,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.750
and even ran over landmines.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.030
Before

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.360
I came,

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.840
I already checked the car.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.240
It's been repaired over 100 times.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.440
Didn't expect

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.970
it would break down
at such a critical moment.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.840
They say Communist cadres are capable.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.750
I didn't expect a leader like you...

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.080
You're a leader, right?

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.000
I...

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.100
I'm a district secretary.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.160
You could say that.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.520
Didn't expect a leader could fix cars.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.750
Fixing cars is nothing.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.270
We've fought in battles

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.400
and killed enemies.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.080
My only regret is

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:05.400
never

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.640
serving in our country's

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.829
Navy or Air Force.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.829
Otherwise...

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.760
Otherwise you'd want to fly planes

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:11.990
and repair warships?

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.000
Imagine me flying a plane—

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.829
that would be quite dashing.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.050
What's so dashing?

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.829
How's the car?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.770
Almost done. Just a moment.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:26.760
Are you thirsty?

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:27.920
I'm fine.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.480
Good.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.400
Here,

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.750
look what I found.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.510
Where did you get these?

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.270
Picked them from that tree over there.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.510
I'm really thirsty.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.480
There are only a few.
Are you really going to eat them?

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:39.720
I just...

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.000
Ladies first.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.070
I'll just take one.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.600
Didn't you say your teeth are sensitive
and afraid of sourness?

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.430
Right.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.530
I'm afraid of sourness.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.140
Right.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.030
Right.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.070
Here, try it.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.790
Try it.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.330
How's it?

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.110
Sweet.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.270
Oh, I didn't wash it.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.160
I usually eat these things

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.270
without washing them.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.870
It's fine.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.400
I don't wash them either.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.480
Why's it still smoking?

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.410
It's about done.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.720
Secretary Zhao,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.240
I can't eat anymore.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.240
You can have it.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.350
I...

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.920
I'm afraid of sourness.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.730
It's sweet.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:25.640
You...

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.770
can eat it now.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.910
Alright then.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.550
Okay.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.110
I'll go wash my handkerchief over there.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.550
No need.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.210
Let me do it.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.760
Sweet.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.360
Sweet.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.450
I'll be right back.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.070
Ms. Yi.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.000
Ms. Yi.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.720
Let me wash it.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.750
No need. I'll do it.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:49.750
Let me.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.270
Really.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.250
Give it to me.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.550
Minister Wen!

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.310
Are you okay?

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.830
I'm fine.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:08.930
Don't come over.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:09.890
Stay back.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.480
Sorry for the embarrassment.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.880
Washing a handkerchief,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.440
but ended up washing
my pants, socks, and shoes

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.290
all together.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.210
At least the bucket's still here.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.030
Don't.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.270
Stay away, please.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.720
I'll get up by myself.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.680
Step back, please.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.160
I'm sorry.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.120
Alright.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.590
If I had known this would happen,

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.720
I should've just taken it home to wash.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.790
Comrade Yi,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.200
do you know what I usually call him?

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.680
No idea.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.720
Minister Wen?

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.680
Scholar.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.810
A man of both pen and sword.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.050
He can swim in rivers

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.250
and even climb trees.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.750
Look—

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.730
bayberries.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.000
I've never had such good bayberries.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.050
And someone said...

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.030
they're sour.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.480
These aren't for you.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.880
Are they sour?

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.920
Eyes on the road.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.110
I got it.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.830
Don't you trust my driving?

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.870
By the way,

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.310
Scholar,

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.400
aren't your feet wet?

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:02.040
Why don't you

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.830
take off your shoes and dry them?

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.160
No one will laugh at you.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.270
Ah, I see—

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.920
you're worried about

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.510
stinking up Ms. Yi, right?

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.300
Eyes on the road!

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.560
It's late and dark.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.830
Someone's like a nagging wife,

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.300
even pinching me.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.830
Quite strong.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.640
Ouch!

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.510
That hurts!

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.160
Secretary Zhao, you sing so well.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.200
Thank you.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.100
Sing us another song, please.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.920
Well, I'll really sing then.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.270
Be careful not to lure the wolves out.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.030
This road is rough. Let's go slowly.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.070
Comrade Yi,

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.790
we soldiers aren't that particular.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:25.790
Minister Wen's place

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.720
is even plainer.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.750
You call this nice house plain?

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.080
Please.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.990
Come in.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.310
Look.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.810
Quite fancy, isn't it?

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.510
Wen.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.110
Scholar.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.880
Look who's

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.030
here.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:56.850
Minister Wen.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.510
Welcome.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.370
Please come in.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.830
I brought some flowers.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.350
Should we put them in water?

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.880
Sure. Do you have a vase?

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.270
A vase? Yes.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.650
Hurry, find one.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.110
This one will do.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.140
Oh right.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.120
And this one too.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.070
Which looks better?

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.510
Back when we were in the army,

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.310
we often used this for flowers.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.310
Let's use this one instead.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.830
This one?

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.310
Good.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.960
Let me do it.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.110
I'll go to the kitchen

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.110
and take care of this.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.030
Thanks, Zhao.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.480
Without a woman in the house,

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.350
he just muddles through everything.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.270
We'll make do.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:37.690
Hurry.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.320
Alright.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.220
Come in, please.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.640
Should I help in the kitchen?

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.480
No, no, no.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.240
The kitchen is too small.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.720
Can't fit that many people.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.720
Please have a seat.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.370
Okay.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.920
Is this where you usually work?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.120
Yes, this is my study.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.110
Have a seat.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.480
Shall we listen to a record?

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:11.830
Sure.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.990
Rachmaninoff?

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.110
Yes.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.480
Are you okay?

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.070
I'm sorry.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.040
Are you alright?

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.200
It seems your chair doesn't welcome me.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.860
How could that be?

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.210
Are you okay?

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.230
I'm fine.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.350
Well,

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.550
sit over here instead.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.750
This chair is sturdy.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.610
You have so many books.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:17.820
Yes,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.400
my personal collection.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.940
Is this bookshelf sturdy?

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.440
Of course it is.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.200
I'm sorry.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.200
I should have

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.030
thrown the chair away long ago.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.510
I thought I could fix it
and use it a bit longer.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.670
Look, it's even given you trauma.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.830
You know,

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.880
my childhood dream was to have many books

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.880
so I could read whichever one I wanted.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.200
When I was little,
I thought that just having books to read

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.800
would be the happiest thing.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:51.680
Yes,

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.000
of course it would be.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.810
Did you buy all these books
after coming to Shanghai?

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.790
No,

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.720
well,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.480
these thick ones on top

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:03.990
were

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.290
bought in Shanghai.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.350
The ones at the bottom
were all brought from the army.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.270
You carried books
even when you were in the army?

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.270
It became a habit.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.240
From the very first day I enlisted,

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.000
I always stuffed
a few books in my backpack.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.850
Let me get you some tea.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:29.400
Thank you.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:49.820
[Jean-Christophe]

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.830
This is the newly released

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.230
fourth volume of Jean-Christophe, right?

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.270
Yes.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.030
This was Zhaoyuan's favorite book
when he was alive.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.360
Sadly, he only made it
to the third volume.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:21.680
Have some water.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.880
Thanks.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.160
I brought a picture book for Yuanyuan.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.810
Where's Yuanyuan?

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.960
The children are playing upstairs.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.420
They'll come down
when it's time for dinner.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.440
Thank you.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.110
Let's go downstairs
to play with the toy guns.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.570
What do you say, Yuanyuan?

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.590
Looks like they're coming down.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.280
Here are our two birthday kids.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.930
Yuanyuan, look who's here.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.300
Hello, Ms. Yi.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.750
Happy birthday to you.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.880
Here, this is my birthday gift for you.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.100
You can read it with Huzi later.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.400
This is Secretary Zhao's son, Huzi.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.680
It's his birthday too.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680
Hello, Huzi.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.030
Happy day, Mrs. Yi.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.500
What...

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.160
What are you calling her?
Who taught you that?

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.050
Um... well...

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.270
Who taught you that?

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.640
My dad.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.340
When did I ever teach you that?

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.510
Don't talk nonsense.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:29.510
Just call me Ms. Yi.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.030
Yes.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.830
Happy day, Ms. Yi.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.830
Happy birthday to you too.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.400
Changjiang,

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.900
this is Ms. Yi Yi.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.590
Hello, Ms. Yi.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.310
Hello.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.790
This is my son, Changjiang.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.920
Hello, Changjiang.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.890
You must be in middle school now, right?

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:45.950
I'm in high school.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.310
I board at school.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.960
My sister stays at kindergarten.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.200
We both come home once every 2 weeks.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.830
Today is my sister's birthday,

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.830
so I took a day off.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.410
Right.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.070
I'll take them out to play with toy guns.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.830
Okay, Yuanyuan?

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.590
Let's go!

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.440
Alright, go have fun.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:04.680
Slow down.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.440
Ms. Fang's here.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.200
Hangong.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.550
I'm taking the children out to play.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.440
Okay.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.200
Yuanyuan.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.650
Yuanyuan, let me see.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.740
How pretty.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.070
Ms. Fang.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.960
Hello, Chief.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.160
Come here.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.330
Louder—greet the Chief properly.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.900
Hello, Chief.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.160
Hello, Ms. Chang.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:24.480
Ms. Fang,

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.920
I need to talk to you.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.470
Let's go to the study.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.720
Come.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:31.760
Okay.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.720
Chang,

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.390
go help in the kitchen,

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.810
wash some vegetables and such.

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:36.520
Go on.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.640
Alright.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.410
You must be Ms. Yi.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.550
Let's go to the kitchen together.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.350
Okay.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.440
Ms. Fang,

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.270
why did you bring Chang here?

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.030
I've already made it clear—

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.800
she and I aren't a good match.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.030
Then why did you bring Yi Yi?

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.400
What's that supposed to mean?

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.440
We had an appointment.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.480
Zhao Hangong and the two of us

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.360
decided to celebrate
the kids' birthdays together.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.290
It'll be lively.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.200
Lively?

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.440
Really?

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.070
That's good then.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.440
You'd better not have
any ulterior motives.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.770
Yi Yi is the kind of woman

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.030
you'd best keep your distance from.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.440
Ms. Fang,

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.550
you're being too prejudiced against her.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:35.590
What kind of woman is she?

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.270
Alright, let's not argue.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.270
You're not dating her anyway,

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:40.780
right?

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.030
Right.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.970
Just promise me.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.080
You can go ahead with your work.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.240
Ms. Yi and I will cook a couple of dishes.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.010
That's very kind of you.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.520
Alright then.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.790
Can you cook?

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:03.070
A little bit.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.080
Then crack a few eggs.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.240
Okay.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.450
Too slow. You need to be faster.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.720
Your hands look so delicate.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.750
You don't do much housework, do you?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.590
Stop cutting.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.200
You might cut yourself.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.840
Your husband must have pampered you.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.120
You're clearly used to being waited on.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.320
Have you ever listened to symphony?

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.610
Minister Wen likes it.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
I do too.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.240
Like Johann Maninov,

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.030
Rachstrausky's waltz—

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.030
I can hum them all.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.550
You mean Rachmaninoff

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.200
and Johann Strauss?

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.070
Yes.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.000
Isn't that what I just told you?

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.510
You healthcare workers must have it tough.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.090
How do you know I work at a hospital?

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.730
Did Minister Wen tell you?

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.030
No.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.680
I see.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.490
You smelled the Lysol on me, right?

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.570
Actually, I met Minister Wen on my own.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.720
Director Fang's husband was hospitalized.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.160
Minister Wen came to visit.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.270
That's how we met.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.810
Minister Wen

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.420
never mentioned me to you?

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.730
No.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:12.970
That makes sense.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:13.790
Personal relationships are

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.120
not something to discuss with outsiders.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.530
I've heard Director Fang mention you.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.780
To be honest, I feel sorry for you.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.980
If I went through
what you did at your age,

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.840
I probably couldn't handle it.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.650
Chang does a beautiful job.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.980
In Minister Wen's kitchen,

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.940
she acts like she's in her own home.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.800
Isn't that right, Ms. Yi?

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.030
You're not much help standing here.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.320
Let's step outside and talk.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.680
You don't have to.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.010
Dinner's almost ready.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.450
Just stay here.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.830
You can still help out.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:56.830
It's fine.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.780
Director Fang,

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:00.440
I can go talk with you.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.110
Is there a problem?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.760
Ms. Chang,

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360
stop for a moment.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.960
Let's talk in the study.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.550
Okay?

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.760
You know I'm not well-educated.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.960
Whatever you want to say,
you can say it here.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.560
Your kitchen is so spacious.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:29.710
I really love kitchens.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.110
I could stay here all day.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.020
I'll wait for you in the study.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.650
Come on.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.030
Actually,

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.310
you should know
what I want to talk to you about.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.480
I don't know, Director Fang.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.540
What kind of relationship

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.390
do you have

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.920
or rather, expect to have

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.710
with Minister Wen?

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.360
I have no expectations, Director Fang.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.360
I don't think you quite understand.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:10.320
Minister Wen's

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.110
feelings and marriage

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.670
are restricted by many factors.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.670
He cannot do whatever he wants.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.280
Jiang, catch them!

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.110
Hangong!

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:18.480
Hurry up.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.150
What's going on?

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.360
Take them out to play.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.030
Okay.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.880
I'm...

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.110
I'm talking about
serious matters here, okay?

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.000
Sorry to interrupt you.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.400
Got you!

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.110
Where

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.800
was I just now?

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.280
You were saying his feelings and marriage

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.080
are restricted by many factors,

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.070
and he cannot...

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.000
Right.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.070
He cannot do whatever he wants.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.590
This isn't just about you

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.360
but applies to everyone.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.550
Although you're not a Party member,

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.580
I hope you can be more honest.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.110
You've read my diary.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.690
I think I've been completely
honest inside and out.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:57.780
About your diary,

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.870
the organization has
already apologized to you.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.510
Can you please stop dwelling on this?

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.970
What I want to say is,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.230
since you've read my diary,

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.480
you should understand

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.840
I don't have much time or energy

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.500
to think about other matters.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.630
I just want to do my job well now

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.890
not worry about food and shelter,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.550
and have a relatively stable
creative environment.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.750
That's enough for me.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.110
I don't expect much

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.760
from life.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:26.920
You

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.320
don't need to make it hard

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.720
for yourself.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.070
At your prime age,

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.440
you have the right to enjoy happiness.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.510
The Communist Party
opposes feudal ethical concepts

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.670
like widowhood chastity.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.360
Don't mind what Zhou says.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.360
She's still young

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.420
and doesn't understand life.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.590
So I hope

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:51.250
you'll start a family
if you meet a suitable man.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.730
I'll keep an eye out for you too.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.190
However,

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.020
I hope you can lower your standards a bit.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.090
Thank you, Director Fang.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.320
I hope you'll go back and think it over.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.120
You may go now.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.220
Let's go.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.190
Comrade Chang.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.960
You can call me Huijuan,

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.050
or just Juan if you prefer.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.710
That's what everyone calls me.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:37.840
Comrade Chang,

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.750
if I've done anything

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.630
that gave you the wrong idea,

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.670
I apologize.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.480
I can tell you clearly today

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.440
that between us,

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.410
there won't be anything
beyond comradeship.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.710
Do you understand?

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.480
Director Fang said you liked me

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.010
and you agreed to it.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.090
Director Fang misunderstood me.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.000
I never meant it that way.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.070
I know.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:07.920
My family is poor

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.480
and I'm not educated.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.960
But isn't the Communist Party
for the poor?

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.400
Would a Communist leader
look down on someone like me?

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.670
You're a good comrade

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.930
and an excellent medical worker.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.030
I respect you.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.240
I've been working hard to study.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.720
Lately I've been listening to symphonies—

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.320
I can even hum it now.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.360
Then tell me,

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.610
what do I need to do to be worthy of you?

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.760
Comrade Chang,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.280
we live in a new society.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.480
No one should change themselves

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.670
just to suit someone else.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:41.510
Do you understand?

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.150
No, that's not it.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.510
You're not being sincere.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.880
If I were educated and cultured,

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.930
would you still treat me this way?

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.880
Comrade Chang,

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.510
I believe

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.980
you'll find

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.940
a life partner who truly suits you.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.430
What about Yi Yi then?

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.870
She's older than me.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.170
and she's been married before.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.290
She just had a few more
days of education than me.

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.560
What do you see in her?

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.940
Why are you crying?

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:20.930
Director Fang,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.030
I know Chief Wen doesn't like me.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.630
He likes women like Yi Yi.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.990
Where's Yi Yi?

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.880
I sent her away.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:39.880
Ms. Fang,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.240
what are you doing?

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.030
Yi Yi is my invited guest.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.670
She came for the child's birthday.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.840
She didn't even take a single bite.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.320
Do...

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.440
Do you think that's appropriate?

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.000
Forget about Yi Yi.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.400
Her stubborn personality

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.190
and that so-called artist temperament

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:55.480
are all time bombs

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.360
in your future relationship.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.900
You don't understand her.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.690
She's not the way you say she is.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.230
Besides, there's nothing like

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.030
what you're suggesting between us.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.670
Fine.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.070
Tell me the truth.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.630
Do you have feelings for Yi Yi or not?

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:12.000
If not,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.070
give me your word,

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.070
then you can rest assured

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.150
that I won't interfere

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.680
in Yi Yi's matters anymore.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.710
But one thing—

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.300
you cannot...

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.440
you cannot lie to me.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.920
Rumei's been gone for years.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:32.700
Have you ever looked at
any other woman this way?

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.710
You think I don't know
what's on your mind?

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.110
I just don't understand.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.570
What's so good about Yi Yi?

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.890
You two are completely incompatible.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.380
Well, intellectuals have one good quality:

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.390
they care about reputation.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.640
I've already

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.840
made things

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.480
completely clear to her.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.670
Yi Yi knows what to do.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.700
What did you say to her?

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.010
Madam,

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:58.200
is dinner ready?

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.600
I'm hungry.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.230
Come in.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.540
Ms. Yi.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.120
Stayed up late again?

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.590
I heard

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.550
the light in your room

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.110
was on all night yesterday.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:21.930
Oh right,

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.300
I forgot.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.180
You don't like being supervised.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.400
It's fine.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.330
Do you need something?

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.280
There's an urgent task.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.060
Our city has an upcoming
foreign affairs event.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.230
Some important
foreign guests will attend,

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.090
along with foreign journalists.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.030
The city leaders require

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.000
every cadre at the event

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.280
to wear a suit.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:43.840
But there aren't any ready-made ones.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.300
They must be custom-made.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.000
The city leadership

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.710
has mobilized all technicians

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.070
and designers in the city.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.190
Our workshop has been
assigned some work too.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.720
Here's the personnel list.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.000
Ms. Su,

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.640
I've never made men's clothing.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.380
Besides, making suits requires expertise.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:13.950
My skills aren't up to it.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.280
This is a political task.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.340
You must accept it.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.800
I'll get busy now.
