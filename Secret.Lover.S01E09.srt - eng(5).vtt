00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.870
If you keep your relationship a secret,

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.620
they'll think you're alone,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.420
and start worrying about you.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.730
One day you won't be able to hide it.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.350
When that day comes,

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.050
if they can't accept it...

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.840
what will you do?

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.870
Would you still insist on being with Tuo?

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.990
Are you leaving already?

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.410
We're about to eat
once your dad finishes his shower.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.340
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.830
Next time, Mom.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.250
I'll bring Tuo back for a meal next time.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:17.940
Okay.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.060
Bye.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.210
Don't cry now.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.470
I'm not forcing you to break up.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.120
I'm sorry.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.390
I'm sorry.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.590
I'm sorry.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.120
Even if my parents are against it,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.420
I still want to be with Tuo.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.940
I really like him.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.730
I didn't realize I loved him this much.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.300
Yushu, I'm going home.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.090
If you've made up your mind, go for it.
I've got your back.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.020
Thanks.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.580
Do you have to rush off like that?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.530
Do you remember that tree?

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.880
The first time I met you,

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.670
you were hiding beside that tree,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.700
looking so scared.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.440
We used to play wedding games here
with Xiaoyang.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.080
Every time we played rock-paper-scissors
to decide who'd be the groom,

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.020
I always lost.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.700
What I told you that day
at the hospital...

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.020
We can't go back.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.480
We can't go back to just being friends.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.470
I can't just be friends with you.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.790
Junxi...

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.340
I know,

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.630
I'm often a step behind,

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.910
and that makes you anxious.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:24.890
But actually,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.090
I never wanted to keep us a secret.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.180
I just didn't know what to do.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.160
Han Tuo, I won't break up with you.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.800
Even if you win rock-paper-scissors
100 times, 1,000 times,

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.200
I still won't agree to it.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.290
Junxi.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.250
Han Tuo, I like you.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.520
It's not just like,

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.680
I love you.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.840
I'm sorry.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.390
I always thought

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.470
I was forcing you into this relationship,

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.870
and that's why you wanted
to keep it secret.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.280
I thought you didn't like me that much.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.950
I was scared...

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.460
that you were only with me out of habit.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.350
I was anxious...

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.650
I thought you would give up on me one day.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.510
If I broke up with you first,

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.520
I wouldn't be abandoned.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.560
Once I hold your hand, I'll never let go.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.340
I won't leave you behind.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.590
I'm sorry...

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.510
for making you feel so insecure.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.580
I'm the one who should apologize.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.380
We promised to be family,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.520
but when you needed me most,
I said break up.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.220
I'm sorry.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.040
We're even now.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.870
Let's stay together.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.720
Forever.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.050
Let's always be together.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.190
Forever.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.500
Let's go home.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:38.670
Okay.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:42.470
No.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.620
I just got out of the hospital,

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.080
and he won't even

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.200
stay for lunch with us.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.450
Such an ungrateful son.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.250
That's enough.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.240
You've been nagging
since before lunch.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.900
Doesn't your mouth get tired?

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.340
I told you he has his own things to do.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.620
Don't you understand?

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.130
I'm just saying it at home.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.360
I didn't say anything in front of Junxi.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.230
Stop nagging.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.950
Look, Yushu can't even eat.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.020
Why are you back?

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.510
Lunch's already over.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.640
Why are you back?

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.410
Why did you suddenly come back?

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.340
Dad,

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.130
Mom.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.880
I have something to tell you.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.340
[In the Next Episode]

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.170
Han Tuo.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.110
Let's have a relationship
that feels light and easy.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.150
Are you...

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.120
serious about Junxi, right?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.950
Let go.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.380
No.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.370
Wherever he is,

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.960
that's my home.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.340
Tuo.
